# Checkmate-Escrow — Competitive Chess Betting on Stellar

[![Code Coverage](https://github.com/meetdarc-tech/Checkmate-Escrow/actions/workflows/coverage.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/meetdarc-tech/Checkmate-Escrow/actions/workflows/coverage.yml)

A trustless chess wagering platform built on Stellar Soroban smart contracts. Players stake tokens before a match, and the winner is automatically paid out the moment the game ends — no middleman, no delays, no trust required.


## 🎯 What is Checkmate-Escrow?

Checkmate-Escrow combines competitive chess with Stellar's fast settlement to create a fully on-chain betting platform for casual and high-stakes matches.

Players:

- Stake tokens into a Soroban escrow contract before a match begins
- Play their game on Lichess or Chess.com as normal
- Receive automatic payouts the instant the match result is verified on-chain

A custom Oracle bridges the Chess.com / Lichess API to the smart contract, verifying match results and triggering payouts without any manual intervention.

This makes Checkmate-Escrow:

✅ Trustless (no platform can withhold or delay winnings)  
✅ Transparent (all stakes and payouts are verifiable on-chain)  
✅ Instant (Stellar's fast finality means payouts settle in seconds)  
✅ Accessible (anyone with a Stellar wallet can participate)

## 🚀 Features

- **Create a Match**: Set stake amount, token address, and link a Lichess/Chess.com game ID
- **Flexible Token Support**: Any Stellar token address is accepted by default; once the admin adds at least one token via `add_allowed_token`, only allowlisted tokens are accepted for new matches
- **Escrow Stakes**: Both players deposit funds into the contract before the game starts
- **Oracle Integration**: Real-time result verification via Lichess/Chess.com APIs
- **Automatic Payouts**: Winner receives the full pot the moment the result is confirmed
- **Draw Handling**: Stakes are returned to both players in the event of a draw
- **Admin Controls**: Pause/unpause, oracle rotation, admin transfer, and match timeout configuration
- **Transparent**: All escrow balances and payout history are verifiable on-chain

## 🗺️ Match Lifecycle

Matches move through the following states:

```
Pending ──► Active ──► Completed
   │                       ▲
   └──► Cancelled ◄─────────
         (expire_match / cancel_match)
```

| State       | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Pending`   | Match created; awaiting deposits from both players       |
| `Active`    | Both players have deposited; game is in progress         |
| `Completed` | Oracle submitted result; payout executed                 |
| `Cancelled` | Cancelled before activation, or expired after timeout    |

## 🎓 Smart Contract API

### Match Management

```
create_match(player1, player2, stake_amount, token, game_id, platform) -> u64
get_match(match_id) -> Match
cancel_match(match_id, caller) -> Result<(), Error>
expire_match(match_id) -> Result<(), Error>
get_player_matches(player) -> Vec<u64>
get_pending_matches() -> Vec<Match>
get_active_matches() -> Vec<Match>
get_completed_matches() -> Vec<Match>
get_completed_matches_paginated(offset, limit) -> Vec<Match>
```

- `create_match` must be authorized by `player1`.
- `cancel_match` may be called by either matched player.
- `expire_match` may be called by anyone once the match timeout elapses.

### Escrow

```
deposit(match_id, player) -> Result<(), Error>
is_funded(match_id) -> Result<bool, Error>
get_escrow_balance(match_id) -> Result<i128, Error>
```

#### `is_funded` vs `get_escrow_balance`

These two functions answer different questions and are easy to confuse:

- **`is_funded(match_id)`** — returns `true` only when *both* players have deposited their stake (i.e. the match has transitioned to `Active`). It reflects deposit flags, not token balances. Use this to gate game-start logic.

- **`get_escrow_balance(match_id)`** — returns the total token amount currently held in escrow for the match: `0`, `1×stake`, or `2×stake` depending on how many players have deposited. Once a match is `Completed` or `Cancelled` (funds already paid out or refunded), this always returns `0` regardless of on-chain token balances.

Examples:

| Scenario                              | `is_funded` | `get_escrow_balance` |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Only player1 deposited                | `false`     | `1 × stake_amount`   |
| Both players deposited (Active)       | `true`      | `2 × stake_amount`   |
| Match completed (payout done)         | `true`      | `0`                  |
| Match cancelled (refunds done)        | `false`     | `0`                  |

### Contract Metadata

```
get_contract_version() -> String
```

- Returns the crate version from `Cargo.toml` (e.g. `"0.1.0"`) as a semver-formatted string. Clients can use this to detect version mismatches against a deployed contract.

### Oracle & Payouts

```
get_oracle_address() -> Address
submit_result(match_id, winner, caller) -> Result<(), Error>
submit_result_with_oracle_record(match_id, winner, game_id) -> Result<(), Error>
submit_result_batch(results: Vec<(match_id, winner)>, caller) -> Result<Vec<Option<Error>>, Error>
```

- `get_oracle_address()` returns the oracle address currently configured on the contract. This is a view function that requires no authentication and is intended for off-chain clients, frontends, and monitoring tools to verify oracle configuration without reading raw contract storage. Returns `Error::Unauthorized` if the contract has not been initialized.

- `submit_result_batch` settles multiple matches in a single call, reducing oracle transaction overhead. `caller` must be the configured oracle. Each match is processed independently — a failure on one (e.g. `NotFunded`, `InvalidState`) does not stop the rest from being processed. The returned `Vec` has one entry per input entry, in the same order: `None` on success, `Some(Error)` on failure for that match. (Soroban's contract ABI has no `Result` element type, so `Option<Error>` is the on-chain equivalent of `Result<(), Error>` here.)

- `submit_result` is called by the configured oracle address and requires oracle authorization.
- `submit_result_with_oracle_record` is the canonical oracle integration path and stores the verified `game_id` for audit.

`submit_result` verifies the caller, records the winner, and immediately executes the payout (or refund on draw) in a single transaction. There are no separate `verify_result` or `execute_payout` functions.

### Admin Controls

```
set_match_timeout(seconds) -> Result<(), Error>
get_match_timeout() -> Result<u64, Error>
set_maximum_stake(amount: Option<i128>) -> Result<(), Error>
set_protocol_config(config: ProtocolConfig) -> Result<(), Error>
get_protocol_config() -> Result<ProtocolConfig, Error>
admin_freeze_player(player, reason) -> Result<(), Error>
admin_unfreeze_player(player) -> Result<(), Error>
is_player_frozen(player) -> bool
get_frozen_players() -> Vec<Address>
```

All admin-control functions below require authorization from the configured admin address.

- **Match timeout** — `set_match_timeout` sets how long (in seconds) a `Pending` match may wait for both deposits before anyone can call `expire_match` on it. Value must fall within `[MIN_MATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, MAX_MATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS]` (1–90 days), enforced with `Error::InvalidTimeout`. `get_match_timeout` returns the current value in seconds. The timeout is stored in `ProtocolConfig::match_timeout_seconds` and defaults to `DEFAULT_MATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (30 days).
- **Maximum stake** — `set_maximum_stake` caps the `stake_amount` accepted by `create_match` and its variants. Pass `Some(amount)` to set a cap (rejected with `Error::InvalidAmount` if `amount <= 0`), or `None` to remove the cap (the default). `create_match` rejects any `stake_amount` above the configured cap with `Error::InvalidAmount`. Read the current cap via `get_protocol_config().maximum_stake`.
- **Protocol fee** — `ProtocolConfig::protocol_fee_bps` (basis points, default `0`) and `ProtocolConfig::fee_recipient` control a platform fee taken out of the winner's payout: `protocol_fee = stake_amount * 2 * protocol_fee_bps / 10_000`, transferred to `fee_recipient` when `submit_result` resolves a winner. Draw refunds are never charged this fee. Set both fields via `set_protocol_config`; `protocol_fee_bps` above `10_000` (100%) is rejected with `Error::InvalidAmount`.
- **Full config read** — `get_protocol_config` returns the complete `ProtocolConfig` struct as currently stored on-chain (treasury, vesting duration, cancellation fee, stablecoin-only mode, maximum stake, match timeout, protocol fee, and fee recipient). Off-chain tools and the frontend can call this single function instead of making multiple separate admin queries to reconstruct contract state.
- **Player freeze** — `admin_freeze_player(player, reason)` blocks a single player from creating matches (any `create_match` variant, including being named as the opponent) and depositing, without pausing the contract for anyone else. The `reason` is stored on-chain for auditability, and `admin_unfreeze_player(player)` reverses it. A freeze deliberately does **not** block fund recovery — the frozen player can still cancel/expire pending matches and claim payouts, and existing `Active` matches settle normally. Rejections surface as `Error::ContractPaused` (the error enum is at its 50-variant XDR cap, so this reuses the closest existing code). Query state via `is_player_frozen(player)` and `get_frozen_players()`.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

**The Problem**: Current chess betting and tournament prize payouts are slow and rely entirely on the platform's honesty. Players have no guarantee their winnings will be paid out fairly or on time.

**The Solution**: By holding stakes in a Soroban smart contract and automating payouts via a verified Oracle, Checkmate-Escrow removes the need to trust any third party.

**Blockchain Benefits**:

- No platform can withhold or manipulate payouts
- Transparent stake and payout history for every match
- Programmable rules enforced by smart contracts
- Accessible to anyone with a Stellar wallet

**Target Users**:

- Competitive chess players looking for trustless wagering
- Chess clubs and tournament organizers
- Casual players wanting skin-in-the-game matches
- Developers building on Stellar/Soroban

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **v1.0 (Current)**: Token-allowlist escrow, Lichess Oracle integration, basic match flow
- **v1.1**: Chess.com Oracle, expanded token support
- **v2.0**: Multi-game tournaments, bracket payouts
- **v3.0**: Frontend UI with wallet integration
- **v4.0**: Mobile app, ELO-based matchmaking, leaderboards
