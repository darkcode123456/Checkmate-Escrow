# Contributing to Checkmate-Escrow

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Checkmate-Escrow! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Soroban CLI
- Stellar CLI
- Git

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/checkmate-escrow.git
   cd checkmate-escrow
   ```
3. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```
5. Run tests to verify your setup:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test.sh
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation updates
- `refactor/` for code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. Write clear, concise commit messages
2. Keep commits focused on a single change
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed

### Testing

Run the full test suite before submitting:

```bash
cargo test
```

For specific contract tests:

```bash
cargo test -p escrow
cargo test -p oracle
```

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard formatting: `cargo fmt`
- Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check` before opening a PR to catch formatting drift across all crates (contracts, oracle-service, e2e-tests, etc.). The CI `Test` job runs this check first and will fail without running tests if any file is out of format.
- Optionally add a pre-commit hook to automate this: `echo 'cargo fmt --all -- --check' > .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
- Run clippy for linting: `cargo clippy`
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable names

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation in `docs/` for architectural changes
- Add inline comments for non-obvious code
- Add or update Soroban contract guidance in `docs/contributing-contracts.md` when changing contract storage, TTL, or auth behavior
- Add or update oracle guidance in `docs/CONTRIBUTING_ORACLE.md` when changing the oracle service, adding platform clients, or modifying result verification
- Update README.md if adding new features or changing setup steps
- Check repository health and link validity with `./scripts/repository_health_check.sh`
- **When adding or renaming an error variant in `contracts/escrow/src/errors.rs` or `contracts/oracle/src/errors.rs`:** update `docs/error-codes.md` in the same PR — add a new row to the relevant table with the `Since` column set to the next version, and add an entry to the [Error Code Changelog](docs/error-codes.md#error-code-changelog) section at the bottom of that file.

See [docs/repository-health-checklist.md](docs/repository-health-checklist.md) for checklist details.

## Updating the Changelog

Every pull request **must** include a changelog entry. This keeps the release history accurate and helps reviewers understand the impact of a change at a glance.

### Where to add your entry

Open `CHANGELOG.md` and add your entry under the `## [Unreleased]` section at the top of the file. If that section does not exist yet, add it directly below the introductory paragraph.

### Entry format

The project follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) convention. Use one of these subsection headings — add only the ones that apply:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Short description of a new feature or capability.

### Changed
- Short description of a change to existing behavior.

### Fixed
- Short description of a bug that was fixed.

### Removed
- Short description of something that was removed.
```

### Full entry template

Copy the block below into `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` and delete the subsections you don't need:

```markdown
### Added
- <!-- Describe new features or functions introduced by this PR -->

### Changed
- <!-- Describe modifications to existing behavior, APIs, or configuration -->

### Fixed
- <!-- Describe bugs or incorrect behavior that this PR corrects -->

### Removed
- <!-- Describe features, flags, or APIs that were deleted -->
```

### Guidelines

- Write entries from the perspective of a **user or integrator**, not an implementer. Explain *what changed* and *why it matters*, not *how* the code was restructured.
- Use the past tense and start with a capital letter: `Added support for …`, `Fixed incorrect payout when …`
- One bullet per logical change. If a PR touches multiple independent areas, add one bullet for each.
- Do **not** include internal refactors or test-only changes unless they affect observable behavior.
- When a version is released, maintainers will move `[Unreleased]` entries into a new versioned section (e.g. `## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-01`). You don't need to do this yourself.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch
3. Fill out the PR template with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Related issue numbers (if applicable)
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)
4. Wait for review and address feedback

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update documentation
- Respond to review comments promptly
- Squash commits if requested

### Code Owners and Review Requirements

The repository uses a [`CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) file to automatically request reviews from designated maintainers when changes touch critical areas:

- **Smart contracts** (`/contracts/escrow/`, `/contracts/oracle/`): Reviewed by @StellarCheckMate/contracts team
- **CI/CD and build configuration** (`/.github/`, `/scripts/`): Reviewed by @StellarCheckMate/maintainers
- **Documentation** (`/docs/`): Reviewed by @StellarCheckMate/docs team
- **Other changes**: Reviewed by @StellarCheckMate/maintainers

When a PR touches files in these paths, GitHub automatically requests review from the designated owners. This ensures that security-critical contract code and infrastructure changes receive appropriate scrutiny. All requested reviews must be approved before merging.

## Issue Labels

We use a shared label taxonomy to keep issue and PR triage consistent. See [docs/label-taxonomy.md](docs/label-taxonomy.md) for definitions of labels like `good first issue`, `wave-ready`, and `help-wanted`.

## Coding Standards

### Rust Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Use `PascalCase` for types and enums
- Prefer explicit error handling over panics
- Use `Result<T, Error>` for fallible operations
- Document public APIs with doc comments

### Smart Contract Patterns

- Validate all inputs at function entry
- Use appropriate storage types (instance, persistent, temporary)
- Extend TTL for long-lived data
- Emit events for state changes
- Require authentication for privileged operations

### Testing Standards

- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Use descriptive test names: `test_function_name_condition_expected_result`
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify events are emitted correctly

For a comprehensive guide on writing tests, see [**Testing Guide**](docs/contributing-tests.md) which covers:
- Soroban test environment setup
- Mocking addresses and tokens
- Test organization and patterns
- Complete annotated example tests

### Testing Conventions: Prefer `try_` Over `#[should_panic]`

When testing that a contract function returns a specific error, prefer the typed
`try_` variant over `#[should_panic]`. The `try_` approach asserts the *exact*
error variant, making failures easier to diagnose and preventing tests from
accidentally passing due to an unrelated panic.

**Avoid** — `#[should_panic]` only checks that *something* panicked:

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "Error(Contract, #10)")]
fn test_create_match_with_zero_stake_fails() {
    let (env, contract_id, _oracle, player1, player2, token, _admin) = setup();
    let client = EscrowContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    client.create_match(&player1, &player2, &0, &token,
        &String::from_str(&env, "game"), &Platform::Lichess);
}
```

**Prefer** — `try_` asserts the exact error variant:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_create_match_with_zero_stake_returns_invalid_amount() {
    let (env, contract_id, _oracle, player1, player2, token, _admin) = setup();
    let client = EscrowContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let result = client.try_create_match(&player1, &player2, &0, &token,
        &String::from_str(&env, "game"), &Platform::Lichess);
    assert_eq!(result, Err(Ok(Error::InvalidAmount)));
}
```

Use `#[should_panic]` only for cases where the contract panics with a plain
string message rather than a typed error (e.g. double-initialization):

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "Contract already initialized")]
fn test_double_initialize_fails() {
    // ...
    client.initialize(&oracle, &admin);
    client.initialize(&oracle, &admin); // panics with a string, not a typed Error
}
```

## Contributing by Component

### Smart Contract Changes

For changes to `contracts/escrow` or `contracts/oracle`, see [docs/contributing-contracts.md](docs/contributing-contracts.md) for detailed guidance on:
- Authorization patterns and `require_auth`
- Storage tiers and state layout
- TTL management
- Contract initialization and upgrade safety
- Events and observability

### Updating the ABI Snapshot

The escrow contract's public ABI is protected by a snapshot check in CI
(`.github/workflows/abi-snapshot.yml`). If you intentionally add, remove, or
rename a public function in `contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`, you **must** update
the baseline before merging or CI will fail.

**Procedure:**

1. Build the escrow contract for release:
   ```bash
   cd contracts/escrow
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

2. Inspect the WASM to get the current function list:
   ```bash
   stellar contract inspect \
     --wasm ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/escrow.wasm \
     --output json > /tmp/current-spec.json
   ```

3. Update `contracts/escrow/contract-spec.json`:
   - Add a new `{ "name": "your_function" }` entry to the `"functions"` array
     for each new function, or remove the entry for deleted functions.
   - Update `"_generated_at"` to today's date.
   - Commit the updated file as part of your PR.

4. Add a changelog entry in `CHANGELOG.md` describing the ABI change:
   ```markdown
   ### Changed
   - Added `your_function` to the escrow contract public ABI (since v0.X.0).
   ```

5. Update `docs/error-codes.md` if the change introduces or removes error
   variants (see the [Since column requirement](#documentation) above).

**Why this matters:** The escrow ABI is effectively a public interface. Clients
(oracle service, frontend, third-party integrators) depend on stable function
names and signatures. An accidental rename or removal can silently break live
integrations. The snapshot check catches these regressions at PR review time,
not in production.

### Oracle Service Changes

For changes to the off-chain oracle service, see [docs/CONTRIBUTING_ORACLE.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING_ORACLE.md) for detailed guidance on:
- Local oracle setup and environment configuration
- Running and writing oracle integration tests
- Adding support for new chess platform clients
- Result verification and security patterns
- API rate limiting and error handling
