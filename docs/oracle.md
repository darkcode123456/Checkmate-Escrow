## Health Check

The oracle exposes a `/health` endpoint to monitor real-time connectivity and dependency health.

**Endpoint:** GET /health

Returns a comprehensive health status report including:
- Overall service status: `healthy`, `degraded`, or `unhealthy`
- Per-dependency checks (Stellar RPC, escrow contract, oracle contract, chess APIs)
- Latency metrics for each dependency
- Synthetic canary check status (planned)
- Service uptime counter

**Full documentation:** See [docs/monitoring-health-checks.md](monitoring-health-checks.md)

**Integration guide:** See [docs/health-check-integration.md](health-check-integration.md)

The health check system runs every 30 seconds and performs real connectivity
verification to each critical dependency. Unlike the old hardcoded response, the
health check now:

1. Verifies Stellar RPC connectivity with actual `getNetwork` calls
2. Tests escrow contract reachability via `getLedgerEntries`
3. Tests oracle contract reachability
4. Checks chess platform API availability (Lichess and Chess.com)
5. Distinguishes transient failures (rate limits, timeouts) from permanent outages

---

## HTTP Layer Protections (WAF & Rate Limiting)

Every request to the oracle service's exposed HTTP endpoints (`/health`, `/api/docs`,
`/api/openapi.yaml`) passes through two `axum` middleware layers before reaching a
handler, applied in `oracle-service/src/main.rs`:

1. **WAF** (`oracle_service::middleware::waf`) — outermost layer, runs first:
   - Burst rate limiting: more than 20 requests/second from one IP → `429`
   - Oversized body: `Content-Length` over 1 MiB → `413`
   - Long URI: request URI over 2,048 characters → `400`
   - Null byte in URI → `400`
2. **Rate limiter** (`oracle_service::middleware::rate_limit`) — token-bucket
   limiting per IP (100 req/min) and per `X-Api-Key` (1,000 req/min), returning
   `429` with `X-RateLimit-*`/`Retry-After` headers when a bucket is exhausted.

This is distinct from the on-chain [Oracle Submission Rate
Limiting](#oracle-submission-rate-limiting) (which throttles `submit_result`
calls) and from the client-side platform rate limiters described in [Chess.com
API Rate Limits](#chesscom-api-rate-limits-timeouts-and-offline-fallback) —
this section covers protection of the oracle service's own HTTP surface.

## Oracle Contract Role

The escrow contract uses its configured oracle address as the authoritative
permission for submitting results to trigger payouts. The oracle contract is
supplementary: it does not authorise escrow payouts or act as a gatekeeper for
escrow result submission. It provides an audit log and an independent on-chain
record of results that can be queried later — and, as of the m-of-n consensus
feature described below, it can itself require independent agreement from
multiple staked oracles before that record is written, rather than trusting a
single admin-controlled submitter.

The off-chain oracle service today is the trusted operator that:
1. discovers matches needing verification via a periodic reconciliation task
   that pages through `EscrowContract::get_active_matches_paginated` and
   enqueues any `Active` match for which `OracleContract::has_result` is
   still `false`,
2. verifies the platform result for `game_id` using an external chess API,
3. calls `EscrowContract::submit_result(match_id, winner)` from the escrow-side
   oracle address,
4. records the same result in `OracleContract` for auditing and optional
   verification.

Step 1 is what makes a match's *first* submission attempt happen at all: the
durable queue's retry/backoff/dead-letter machinery only processes entries
that are already enqueued, and reconciliation is the only thing that enqueues
a match for the first time. It re-scans on every cycle
(`ORACLE_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_SECS`, default 60s) rather than only at
startup, so it also recovers a match that becomes `Active` while the service
is down and repopulates the queue if its on-disk state is ever lost.


The two contracts are separate:
- `EscrowContract` enforces match state, funding, and oracle address
  authentication.
- `OracleContract` enforces admin-only result storage and exposes public or
  admin-gated read interfaces. It additionally supports a genuine multi-oracle
  consensus path — see [m-of-n Oracle Consensus](#m-of-n-oracle-consensus).

The complete pipeline — deploying the release WASM artifacts, creating a
match, depositing both stakes, recording the result, settling, and claiming
the payout — is exercised end to end by the sandboxed lifecycle suite in
`e2e-tests/`; see [docs/e2e-testing.md](e2e-testing.md).

## Oracle Slash Relay

### Overview

When a dispute is overturned by community vote in the escrow contract, the `mark_dispute_for_oracle_slash` function emits an `oracle_slash_signal` event containing the dispute ID, the oracle address to slash, and the amount to slash. An off-chain relay service listens for these events and automatically calls the oracle contract's `slash_oracle` function to execute the slashing.

This relay automates the economic penalty for oracles implicated in overturned disputes, ensuring that the oracle accountability mechanism described in the architecture documentation is fully operational.

### Relay Design

The oracle slash relay is designed to be:

1. **Idempotent** — Processing the same `oracle_slash_signal` event multiple times does not double-slash. The relay tracks processed signals in memory and skips duplicates.
2. **Safe** — If an oracle named in a signal is not registered on the oracle contract, the relay logs a warning and skips slashing rather than crashing.
3. **Resilient** — Network or contract failures are handled gracefully with retries and error logging.

### Event Format

The `oracle_slash_signal` event has the following format:

```
Topic: ["dispute", "oracle_slash_signal"]
Data: (dispute_id: u64, oracle: Address, slash_amount: i128)
```

The relay extracts these fields and calls `slash_oracle(oracle, dispute_id, slash_amount)` on the oracle contract, which now stages the slash rather than applying it immediately — see [Slashing Grace Period](#slashing-grace-period) below.

### Integration

The relay is integrated into the oracle service (`oracle-service/src/slash_relay.rs`) and is automatically enabled when the service starts. It:

1. Subscribes to `oracle_slash_signal` events from the configured escrow contract
2. For each signal, verifies the oracle is registered on the oracle contract
3. Calls `slash_oracle` with the specified amount
4. Records the processed signal to prevent double-slashing

### Testing

The relay is thoroughly tested via:

- **Contract-side tests** (`contracts/escrow/src/tests/slash_relay_tests.rs`) that verify the escrow contract correctly emits slash signals
- **Relay-side tests** (`oracle-service/src/slash_relay.rs`) that verify idempotency and error handling
- **Integration tests** that verify the full flow from signal emission to oracle slashing

## Slashing Grace Period

Slashing was previously immediate and irreversible: a single `slash_oracle`
call moved funds out of the oracle's stake straight to the admin/treasury.
If a slash was triggered by a contract bug, a data-corruption edge case, or
a bad dispute resolution rather than genuine oracle misbehavior, there was
no recourse.

`slash_oracle(oracle_address, match_id, slash_amount)` now **stages** the
slash instead of executing it:

1. It records a `PendingSlash { oracle_address, match_id, slash_amount,
   token, staged_ledger, eligible_ledger }` under
   `DataKey::PendingSlash(oracle_address, match_id)`. No funds move yet and
   the oracle's `oracle_stake` is untouched.
2. `eligible_ledger` is `staged_ledger + slashing_grace_period_ledgers`,
   where the grace period is configured via `set_slashing_grace_period`
   (admin-only) and defaults to `0` (immediate eligibility) when unset.
3. Once the current ledger reaches `eligible_ledger`, anyone may call
   `finalize_slash(oracle_address, match_id)` to actually reduce the
   oracle's stake and transfer the slashed amount to the admin.
4. Before finalization, the admin may call
   `admin_cancel_slash(oracle_address, match_id)` to remove the pending
   slash entirely — the governance intervention this feature exists for.

`get_pending_slash(oracle_address, match_id)` and
`get_slashing_grace_period()` are read-only views for tooling and the
off-chain oracle service.

## m-of-n Oracle Consensus

### Background

Earlier versions of `OracleContract` shipped staking primitives
(`register_oracle_with_stake` / `slash_oracle`) that looked like the
foundation of a decentralized oracle set, but nothing in the contract actually
required multiple oracles to agree. `submit_result` and `submit_batch_results`
are gated purely by `admin.require_auth()`, and their stake check only ever
looks up `OracleRegistration(admin)` — because the admin is the only address
that can call them. In effect, the "oracle" was a single trusted address, and
the staking/slashing machinery was decorative: it could not be triggered by
anything other than a manual admin call.

`submit_oracle_result` (below) is the genuine multi-oracle path. It makes the
existing staking machinery load-bearing: a result-submitting oracle without
adequate stake is rejected, and provable equivocation triggers automatic
slashing. `submit_result` / `submit_batch_results` are unchanged and remain
available — see [Migration path](#migration-path-from-single-oracle).

### Registration and threshold

Each oracle registers independently with its own key and its own stake:

```rust
oracle_client.register_oracle_with_stake(&oracle_address, &stake_amount, &token);
```

**Re-registration tops up, it does not overwrite.** If `oracle_address` is
already registered, `stake_amount` is *added* to its existing `oracle_stake`
rather than replacing it. This is the intended way for an oracle to
replenish its bond after a partial slash (e.g. after landing on the losing
side of a majority vote) — the operational action the m-of-n safety bound
above assumes operators will take. `token` must match the token of the
existing registration; a top-up call with a different token is rejected with
`StakeTokenMismatch`, since stake denominated in two different tokens cannot
be meaningfully summed. A first-time registration behaves exactly as before.

Registering appends the address to the contract's oracle set (queryable via
`get_registered_oracle_count`). The admin configures how many *distinct*
registered oracles must submit a matching result before it finalizes:

```rust
oracle_client.set_consensus_threshold(&m); // m ∈ [1, n]
```

The threshold defaults to **1** if never set — the degenerate single-oracle
configuration described in [Migration path](#migration-path-from-single-oracle).
`get_consensus_threshold()` reads the current value.

### Submitting a vote

```rust
oracle_client.submit_oracle_result(&oracle_address, &match_id, &game_id, &platform, &result);
```

Unlike `submit_result`, this is authenticated by the **submitting oracle**,
not the admin (`oracle_address.require_auth()`). Each call:

1. Rejects if the contract is paused, uninitialized, `game_id` is empty, the
   caller never registered stake (`NotRegisteredOracle`), the caller's stake
   has been slashed to zero (`InsufficientStake`), the match is already
   finalized (`AlreadySubmitted`), or the caller's per-oracle rate limit is
   exceeded (`RateLimitExceeded`) — see [Oracle Submission Rate
   Limiting](#oracle-submission-rate-limiting), which applies identically to
   this path.
2. Groups the vote into a *candidate*: the distinct `(game_id, platform,
   result)` tuple it matches. Each candidate tracks the list of oracles that
   voted for it.
3. If a candidate's submitter count reaches the configured threshold, the
   match **finalizes**: the winning candidate is written to the same
   `Result(match_id)` storage that `submit_result` writes, so `get_result` /
   `has_result` behave identically regardless of which path finalized the
   match.
4. If no candidate has reached the threshold yet, the match stays pending —
   query `get_match_votes(match_id)` to see the current tally.

With the default threshold of 1, a single registered oracle's vote finalizes
immediately: this is the m-of-n code path running in its n=1 degenerate form,
distinct from (but behaviourally equivalent to) the legacy admin-gated
`submit_result`.

### Disagreement handling

Disagreement is resolved with an explicit, two-tier policy: **majority wins,
minority is slashed**, with an **admin-resolved deadlock fallback** for splits
that can never resolve on their own.

**1. Majority wins, minority is slashed (the common case).** When a
candidate's vote count reaches the threshold, the match finalizes with that
result. Every oracle that had already voted for a *different* candidate for
the same match is automatically slashed `MINORITY_SLASH_BPS` (10%) of its
remaining stake, transferred to the admin/treasury address, and an
`oracle / minority` event is emitted naming the slashed oracle. The penalty is
deliberately lighter than the equivocation penalty (below) because landing in
the minority can reflect an honest error — a stale platform-API read, a
transient network partition — rather than malice.

**2. Deadlock → disputed → admin resolution (the unresolvable case).** After
every vote that doesn't finalize, the contract checks whether consensus is
still mathematically reachable: it counts the registered, currently-staked
oracles that haven't yet voted on this match (`remaining_eligible_oracles`),
and checks whether *any* existing candidate's vote count plus that remaining
pool could still reach the threshold. If not — for example, a 3-way split
among 3 oracles at threshold 2, where every oracle has already voted for a
different result — the match is flagged `disputed` (`get_match_votes` returns
`disputed: true`, and an `oracle / disputed` event fires) instead of hanging
forever waiting for votes that can never arrive.

A disputed match is resolved by the admin, who acts as tie-breaker of last
resort — consistent with the admin's existing ultimate authority elsewhere in
this contract (`slash_oracle`, `update_admin`, `pause`):

```rust
oracle_client.resolve_disputed_match(&match_id, &game_id, &platform, &result);
```

This finalizes the match with the admin's chosen result and slashes
`MINORITY_SLASH_BPS` from every oracle whose recorded vote disagreed with it —
so attempting to force a deadlock (to trigger a slower, admin-mediated path)
still costs a losing oracle its stake, the same as losing an ordinary
majority vote.

We chose this policy — rather than escalating every disagreement into
`EscrowContract`'s heavier bonded, snapshot-based dispute-voting system (see
[docs/dispute-governance.md](dispute-governance.md)) — because that mechanism
is designed for economic disputes over a *single* asserted result raised by
third-party token holders, not for reconciling *which of several
independently-submitted oracle results* to accept in the first place. Routing
every m-of-n disagreement through it would mean every close vote incurs a
bond, a voting period, and a quorum check, even though the oracle contract
already has the information needed to resolve most disagreements immediately
via majority count. The admin-resolution fallback here is intentionally
narrow: it only fires when the vote is *unresolvable* by counting, not
whenever there's any disagreement at all. A future iteration could route
`resolve_disputed_match` through the escrow dispute-voting system instead of
direct admin authority, trading a slower resolution for removing the admin as
a trust bottleneck in the rare deadlock case — see [Known
limitations](#known-limitations-of-this-design).

### Equivocation

If the *same* oracle submits two different `(game_id, platform, result)`
votes for the *same* `match_id`, the second submission is provable
equivocation: the oracle has signed two mutually-exclusive claims about the
same event. It cannot be an honest mistake in the way a minority vote can — an
honest oracle simply doesn't re-submit a different answer to the same
question. The vote is discarded (not counted toward any candidate) and the
oracle's **entire remaining stake** is slashed (`EQUIVOCATION_SLASH_BPS`,
100%) — effectively ejecting it from further participation, since
`submit_oracle_result` rejects any oracle with `oracle_stake <= 0` with
`InsufficientStake`.

Equivocation slashing is signaled by the `oracle / equivoc` event rather than
an error return. This is a deliberate consequence of Soroban's execution
model: a contract call that returns `Err` reverts **every** storage write
made during that call, including the slash. Returning an error here would
silently undo the punishment it was reporting. Off-chain callers should treat
a submission that emits `oracle / equivoc` as rejected, exactly as if it had
errored, but detect it by watching contract events rather than the call's
return value.

### Byzantine-fault-tolerance bound

Let `n` be the number of registered, staked oracles and `m` be the configured
threshold. Let `f` be the number of oracles that collude (vote identically on
a false result, in an attempt to force it through).

- **Safety** (a colluding minority cannot force a false result): requires
  `f < m`. If `f ≥ m`, the colluding set alone can supply enough matching
  votes to finalize before any honest oracle needs to act at all.
- **Liveness** (the honest oracles can still finalize the true result even if
  every colluding oracle refuses to cooperate): requires `n − f ≥ m`, i.e.
  `f ≤ n − m`.

Combining both: the system tolerates up to

```
f_max = min(m − 1, n − m)
```

colluding oracles while still guaranteeing both that a false result can't be
forced and that a true result can still be finalized. This bound is maximized
by a simple-majority threshold `m = ⌊n/2⌋ + 1`, which gives the familiar
`f_max = ⌊(n − 1) / 2⌋` — the same "more than half honest" bound as classical
BFT quorum systems. Choosing `m` closer to `n` (e.g. requiring near-unanimity)
tightens the safety margin but weakens liveness, since it takes fewer
colluding/offline oracles to prevent the honest majority from ever reaching
the threshold; choosing `m` closer to 1 does the reverse.

This is a **threshold-voting bound backed by economic slashing**, not a full
Byzantine state-machine-replication protocol: there is no leader election,
view-change, or cryptographic message-authentication step beyond Soroban's
own `require_auth`. A colluding set larger than `f_max` is not cryptographically
prevented from finalizing a false result — it is only made expensive after the
fact via the minority/equivocation slashing described above, and only for
oracles that end up provably in the minority or that equivocate. Operators
choosing `m` should size it, and the number of independently-operated oracles
`n`, so that `f_max` exceeds the number of oracle operators they are willing
to assume could plausibly collude.

### Migration path from single-oracle

## Oracle Performance Metrics & SLA Enforcement

To provide visibility into Oracle response times and prevent slow Oracles from creating poor user experience during match settlement, the contract tracks performance metrics and enforces SLA targets.

### SLA Target & Metrics

- **Target SLA Response Time**: `5,000 ms` (5 seconds).
- **OracleMetrics Structure**:
  - `last_response_time_ms: u64` — Latency of the most recent submission in milliseconds.
  - `avg_response_time_ms: u64` — Cumulative running average response time.
  - `uptime_percentage: u32` — Percentage of submissions meeting the <= 5,000ms SLA target.
  - `total_submissions: u32` — Total count of recorded submissions.
  - `successful_submissions: u32` — Count of on-time submissions meeting the SLA target.
  - `active: bool` — Operational status flag (`true` = active, `false` = deactivated).

### Reading Metrics

Retrieve performance metrics for any registered Oracle using `get_oracle_metrics`:

```rust
let metrics: OracleMetrics = oracle_client.get_oracle_metrics(&oracle_address);
```

### SLA Enforcement and Deactivation

Administrators can deactivate Oracles whose average response time exceeds the 5-second SLA threshold via `deactivate_slow_oracle`:

```rust
oracle_client.deactivate_slow_oracle(&oracle_address)?;
```

- **Requirements**: Admin-only (`admin.require_auth()`).
- **Condition**: `avg_response_time_ms` must be greater than `5,000 ms` (returns `Error::OracleNotSlow` if average response time is <= 5,000 ms).
- **Effect**: Sets `metrics.active = false` and emits `oracle / deact` event. Deactivated Oracles are rejected from submitting further results with `Error::OracleDeactivated`.

### Threshold Configuration

The consensus threshold for m-of-n voting is managed via:
- `set_consensus_threshold`: Set required threshold of matching oracle votes (`m >= 1`).
- `get_consensus_threshold`: Read the current threshold configuration.

The original single-admin-oracle deployment continues to work unmodified:

| | Legacy (`submit_result`) | Consensus (`submit_oracle_result`) |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | `admin.require_auth()` | `oracle.require_auth()` (any registered oracle) |
| Finalizes on | First (and only) call | Threshold-many matching votes |
| Default n | 1 (hardcoded — only admin can call it) | 1 (`ConsensusThreshold` defaults to 1) |
| Disagreement | Not possible — one submitter | Majority-wins-with-slash, or admin-resolved deadlock |

To migrate an existing single-oracle deployment to genuine m-of-n:

1. **Register additional independent oracles.** Each new oracle operator
   calls `register_oracle_with_stake` with its own key and its own stake —
   no admin action is required to add an oracle to the set.
2. **Raise the threshold.** Once enough oracles are registered, the admin
   calls `set_consensus_threshold(m)` with `1 < m ≤ n`. Existing pending
   votes recorded before the change are re-evaluated against the new
   threshold on their next submission; already-finalized results are
   unaffected.
3. **Point the off-chain oracle fleet at `submit_oracle_result`.** Each
   independent oracle service instance authenticates as itself instead of a
   shared admin key.
4. **(Optional) retire the legacy path operationally.** `submit_result` and
   `submit_batch_results` remain callable by the admin indefinitely — they
   are not disabled by raising the threshold. This is intentional for
   backward compatibility and emergency admin override, but it also means
   the admin retains a standing unilateral override regardless of the
   configured m-of-n threshold. Deployments that want the full
   Byzantine-fault-tolerance guarantee above to hold in practice, not just on
   the `submit_oracle_result` path, should treat the admin key with the same
   operational care as an `f_max`-sized set of colluding oracles (e.g. behind
   a multisig or hardware-backed signer used only for emergencies), since it
   can unilaterally finalize any match regardless of the registered oracles'
   votes. Fully removing that override — e.g. a one-way "renounce single-
   submitter admin path" switch — is not implemented; see [Known
   limitations](#known-limitations-of-this-design).

To roll back to single-oracle behavior, call `set_consensus_threshold(1)`;
any one registered oracle's vote (or the admin via the legacy path) then
finalizes a match again.

### Known limitations of this design

- The admin retains a standing override via `submit_result` /
  `submit_batch_results` regardless of the configured threshold (see above).
- The deadlock-resolution fallback (`resolve_disputed_match`) is admin-gated
  rather than routed through `EscrowContract`'s dispute-voting system; see the
  rationale in [Disagreement handling](#disagreement-handling).
- `remaining_eligible_oracles` scans the full registered oracle set on every
  non-finalizing vote (see the [gas benchmarks](#consensus-gas-benchmarks)
  below for measured cost at n = 3/5/10/25) — deployments expecting very
  large oracle sets (hundreds+) should budget for this scaling when sizing
  per-transaction resource limits.
- Vote weight is equal per oracle regardless of stake size; a larger stake
  only means a larger slashing penalty in absolute terms, not more voting
  power. Stake-weighted voting was considered out of scope for this change.

### Consensus gas benchmarks

`contracts/oracle/tests/benchmarks.rs` measures `submit_oracle_result` at
n = 3, 5, 10, and 25 registered oracles, run via:

```bash
cargo test -p oracle --test benchmarks -- --nocapture
```

It isolates two costs that scale differently with the registered oracle set
size `n`:

- **Pending vote** — a submission that does not yet reach the threshold, and
  therefore runs the O(n) deadlock-detection scan over the full registered
  set on every call.
- **Finalizing vote** — the submission that crosses the threshold; its extra
  cost comes from walking each losing candidate's submitter list to
  auto-slash the minority, so it scales with how many oracles already voted
  for a different result, not with `n` directly.

A JSON report is written to
`reports/performance/oracle-consensus-benchmark-results.json`. Representative
CPU-instruction costs from a local run (exact numbers vary by SDK/host
version — treat the report as authoritative over any numbers reproduced
here):

| n (registered oracles) | Pending vote (CPU insns) | Finalizing vote (CPU insns) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 3 | ~390K | ~620K |
| 5 | ~500K | ~730K |
| 10 | ~840K | ~1.00M |
| 25 | ~2.11M | ~1.72M |

The pending-vote cost grows roughly linearly with `n` (the deadlock scan
touches every registered oracle); the finalizing-vote cost grows more slowly,
since it is bounded by the number of minority submitters rather than the full
registry.

## Lichess Integration

This section covers Lichess API integration for result verification and is provided for reference. If you are integrating a new chess platform, follow the patterns established here and in the Chess.com section above.

### API Key Setup

The off-chain oracle service reads the Lichess API token from:

```env
LICHESS_API_TOKEN=lip_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Obtaining a Lichess API Token

1. Visit [lichess.org/account/oauth/token](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token)
2. Create a new personal API token with `Challenge:Write` scope (or `Challenge:Read` for result lookups only)
3. Copy the token to your `.env` file

#### Using the API Token

Set this in your `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):

```env
LICHESS_API_TOKEN=lip_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The token is sent as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer lip_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Game ID Format

Lichess game IDs are **8-character alphanumeric strings** (case-sensitive, lowercase letters and digits only).

They appear in the game URL:

```
https://lichess.org/abcd1234
                    ^^^^^^^^
                    game_id = "abcd1234"
```

### API Endpoint

The oracle fetches game results from Lichess:

```
GET https://lichess.org/game/export/abcd1234?evals=false&clocks=false
```

Optional query parameters reduce response size:
- `evals=false` — omit move evaluations
- `clocks=false` — omit clock data

### Example Request / Response

**Request:**

```http
GET https://lichess.org/game/export/abcd1234?evals=false&clocks=false
Authorization: Bearer lip_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Successful response (white wins):**

```json
{
  "id": "abcd1234",
  "winner": "white"
}
```

**Draw response (winner field absent):**

```json
{
  "id": "abcd1234"
}
```

**Game still in progress (no winner field):**

```json
{
  "id": "abcd1234",
  "status": "started"
}
```

### Response Parsing and Result Mapping

The `winner` field is mapped to the on-chain `Winner` type as follows:

| `winner` field | On-chain `Winner` | Notes                                      |
|---|---|---|
| `"white"` | `Winner::Player1` | Player 1 is always white in the match |
| `"black"` | `Winner::Player2` | Player 2 is always black in the match |
| absent / `null` | `Winner::Draw` | Stakes are refunded to both players |
| anything else | Error | `LichessError::InvalidResponse` — not submitted |

### Error Handling

| Condition | Error variant | Oracle behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Empty game ID | `InvalidGameId` | Rejected before any HTTP call; not retried |
| HTTP 404 | `GameNotFound` | Game ID invalid or not accessible; not retried |
| HTTP non-2xx (other than 404) | `HttpStatus { status }` | Transient; retried with exponential backoff |
| Request timeout (> 30 s) | `Timeout` | Transient; retried with exponential backoff |
| Network error (connection refused etc.) | `Http(reqwest::Error)` | Transient; retried with exponential backoff |
| `winner` field absent/null or invalid value | `InvalidResponse` | Game not finished or parsing error; retried later |

The oracle will **never** submit a result on-chain until a verified terminal `winner` value is received.

---

## game_id Format

The `game_id` field is a platform-specific string that uniquely identifies a
chess game. It is supplied when creating a match and must be passed to the
oracle when submitting a result. The oracle uses it to look up the game outcome
via the platform's public API.

| Platform   | Format                        | Example         | Validation Rule                                      | URL Pattern |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Lichess    | 8-character alphanumeric      | `abcd1234`      | Exactly 8 chars; lowercase letters and digits only   | `https://lichess.org/{game_id}` |
| Chess.com  | Numeric string (7–12 digits)  | `123456789`     | Digits only; no letters or special characters        | `https://www.chess.com/game/live/{game_id}` |

All game IDs are subject to a maximum length of **64 bytes** (`MAX_GAME_ID_LEN`). Submissions exceeding this limit are rejected on-chain with `Error::InvalidGameId` before any off-chain lookup is attempted.

## Validation Rules

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| Max length | 64 bytes (`MAX_GAME_ID_LEN`). Enforced on-chain — `create_match` returns `Error::InvalidGameId` if exceeded. |
| Uniqueness | Each `game_id` can only be used once. A duplicate returns `Error::DuplicateGameId`. |
| Format | Not validated on-chain. Passing a malformed ID will cause the oracle to fail result lookup off-chain. |
| Platform match | The `platform` field must match the source of the `game_id`. Mismatches are not caught on-chain but will cause oracle verification to fail. |

---

## Submitting a Result

Once a game is finished, the off-chain oracle service verifies the result via
an external chess platform API and then submits the verified outcome to the
escrow contract from the configured oracle address.

```rust
// Winner::Player1 | Winner::Player2 | Winner::Draw
escrow_client.submit_result(&match_id, &winner);
```

That escrow submission is the authoritative payout trigger. The escrow contract
trusts only its configured oracle address when authorising `submit_result`.

Separately, the oracle service records the same result in the on-chain
`OracleContract` for auditability and later verification.

```rust
oracle_client.submit_result(&match_id, &game_id, &MatchResult::Player1Wins);
```

For tournament support, the oracle contract also exposes a batch API:
`submit_batch_results`. This lets the oracle submit 10–100 verified match
results in a single atomic transaction.

---

## Chess.com Integration

This section is the primary reference for oracle contributors working with the Chess.com platform. It covers everything needed to fetch a game result from Chess.com and feed it into the on-chain `submit_result` flow.

### API Key Setup

The off-chain oracle service reads the Chess.com API key from:

```env
CHESSDOTCOM_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

#### Obtaining a Chess.com API Key

1. Visit [chess.com/settings/developer](https://www.chess.com/settings/developer)
2. Generate a new access token (or use an existing one if you have one already)
3. Copy the token to your `.env` file (or into your environment variables for production deployment)

#### Using the API Key

Set this in your `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):

```env
CHESSDOTCOM_API_KEY=your-token-here
```

The key is sent as a request header on every Chess.com API call:

```
X-Chess-Com-API-Key: your-token-here
```

> **Note:** The Chess.com public API does not require authentication for game lookups today, but the `CHESSDOTCOM_API_KEY` header is included for forward-compatibility and to receive higher rate-limit tiers if Chess.com introduces them. Contrast this with Lichess, which uses `LICHESS_API_TOKEN` sent as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header.

### Game ID Format

Chess.com game IDs are **numeric strings** (digits only), typically 7–12 digits, found in the game URL:

```
https://www.chess.com/game/live/123456789
                                ^^^^^^^^^
                                game_id = "123456789"
```

The oracle client validates that the ID is non-empty and contains only ASCII digits. Any other character (letters, hyphens, etc.) causes `ChessComError::InvalidGameId` before any network call is made.

Valid example: `"123456789"`  
Invalid examples: `"abc"` (non-numeric), `""` (empty), `"123-456"` (hyphen)

### API Endpoint

The oracle fetches game results from the Chess.com public API:

```
GET https://api.chess.com/pub/game/{game_id}
```

No query parameters are required. The `game_id` path segment must be a valid numeric game ID as described above.

### Example Request / Response

**Request:**

```http
GET https://api.chess.com/pub/game/123456789
X-Chess-Com-API-Key: your-key-here
```

**Successful response (white wins):**

```json
{
  "end": {
    "result": "white"
  }
}
```

**Draw response:**

```json
{
  "end": {
    "result": "draw"
  }
}
```

**Game still in progress (no terminal result yet):**

```json
{
  "end": null
}
```

The oracle only reads the `end.result` field. All other fields in the response are ignored. If `end` is absent or `end.result` is `null`, the oracle treats the game as unfinished and will not submit a result on-chain.

### Response Parsing and Result Mapping

The `end.result` string is mapped to the on-chain `Winner` type as follows:

| `end.result` value | On-chain `Winner`  | Notes                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `"white"`          | `Winner::Player1`  | Player 1 is always white in the match      |
| `"black"`          | `Winner::Player2`  | Player 2 is always black in the match      |
| `"draw"`           | `Winner::Draw`     | Stakes are refunded to both players        |
| anything else      | Error              | `ChessComError::InvalidResponse` — not submitted |
| absent / `null`    | Error              | `ChessComError::InvalidResponse` — game not finished |

The mapping is implemented in `oracle-service/src/oracle/chess_com_client.rs` in the `fetch_result` method.

### Error Handling

| Condition                               | Error variant                  | Oracle behaviour                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Empty or non-numeric game ID            | `InvalidGameId`                | Rejected before any HTTP call; not retried            |
| HTTP 404                                | `GameNotFound`                 | Game ID invalid or game unavailable; not retried      |
| HTTP non-2xx (other than 404)           | `HttpStatus { status }`        | Transient; retried with exponential backoff            |
| Request timeout (> 30 s)               | `Timeout`                      | Transient; retried with exponential backoff            |
| Network error (connection refused etc.) | `Http(reqwest::Error)`         | Transient; retried with exponential backoff            |
| `end.result` absent, null, or unknown   | `InvalidResponse`              | Game not finished or unrecognised result; retried later |

The oracle will **never** submit a result on-chain until a verified terminal `end.result` of `"white"`, `"black"`, or `"draw"` is received.

### Platform API Comparison: Lichess vs Chess.com

Developers integrating a new oracle client or adding support for additional platforms should understand the key differences between Lichess and Chess.com APIs:

| Aspect                    | Lichess                                               | Chess.com                                          |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication** | Required: `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` (required to set scope) | Optional today: `X-Chess-Com-API-Key` header (for forward-compatibility) |
| **API Base URL** | `https://lichess.org` | `https://api.chess.com` |
| **Export Path** | `/game/export/{game_id}[?evals=false&clocks=false]` | `/pub/game/{game_id}` |
| **Rate Limit** | No documented hard limit (client enforces ~2 s spacing) | 30 req/min (client enforces with token bucket) |
| **Per-request Timeout** | 30 seconds | 30 seconds |
| **Result Field** | Top-level `winner` key in JSON response | Nested `end.result` in JSON response |
| **Draw Representation** | `winner` field **absent** (null or omitted) | `end.result` = `"draw"` (explicit string value) |
| **Game ID Format** | Exactly 8 alphanumeric characters (lowercase) | Numeric string, 7–12 digits |
| **Response Format Example (White Wins)** | `{ "id": "abcd1234", "winner": "white" }` | `{ "end": { "result": "white" } }` |
| **Response Format Example (Draw)** | `{ "id": "abcd1234" }` (winner key absent) | `{ "end": { "result": "draw" } }` (explicit) |
| **Game In Progress** | `{ "id": "...", "status": "started" }` (no winner key) | `{ "end": null }` or `{ "end": {} }` (no result key) |

**Key Integration Notes:**

1. **Draw Handling:** This is the most critical difference. Lichess omits the `winner` key for a draw, while Chess.com explicitly sets `end.result = "draw"`. Code that maps the response must handle both conventions.
2. **Rate Limits:** Lichess has no documented limit but should be treated as rate-limited. Chess.com documents 30 req/min. Both use client-side token bucket rate limiters.
3. **Authentication:** Lichess requires auth to set API scopes; Chess.com's public API doesn't require it today, but the header is sent for forward-compatibility.
4. **Field Nesting:** Lichess has a flat response; Chess.com nests the result under `end.result`. Always check for the presence and nullability of fields before parsing.

### Oracle rate-limiter and failover design

The oracle service now uses a shared, clone-safe token bucket for each provider instead of a single global spacing gate. The effective knobs are:

- `capacity`: how many burst requests may be dispatched immediately before the sustained rate starts to throttle
- `refill_rate`: sustained token generation rate in requests/second
- `max_concurrent`: per-provider in-flight request ceiling, distinct from the token-bucket ceiling

Both values are configured in the provider client config (`ChessComClientConfig` / `LichessClientConfig`) and are shared across all concurrent verification tasks for that provider.

The provider registry enforces precedence and failover rules:

1. The first provider in the registry order is the primary source.
2. If the primary returns `ProviderError::Unavailable` or `ProviderError::RateLimited`, the registry tries the next provider immediately.
3. If the provider returns a terminal logical error such as `GameNotFound` or `InvalidGameId`, the registry stops and returns that error without consulting the secondary provider.
4. If every provider is unavailable or rate-limited, the registry returns `ProviderError::AllProvidersFailed` with the per-provider error list preserved in precedence order.

This preserves the distinction the automated oracle pipeline needs:

- `ProviderError::RateLimited` means the provider is healthy but backed off; retry later with the recommended `retry_after` delay.
- `ProviderError::Unavailable` means the provider is down or returning a transient server-side failure; fail over to the next provider immediately.
- `ProviderError::ConcurrencyLimitReached` means the per-provider request queue is saturated; back off or retry later rather than flagging a logical failure.

## Chess.com API Rate Limits, Timeouts, and Offline Fallback

The off-chain Chess.com client (see `oracle-service/src/oracle/chess_com_client.rs`) must obey Chess.com’s public API limits:

- **Rate limit:** **30 requests / minute** (≈ 1 request / 2 seconds, globally).
- **Timeout:** **30 seconds max** per HTTP request.

### Rate limiting behavior

The oracle client uses a client-side rate limiter. If a request would exceed the quota, it waits until tokens are available before issuing the HTTP call.

### Error handling rules

If Chess.com returns:
- **404:** treat as `GameNotFound` (invalid game id or unavailable game).
- **non-2xx:** treat as `HttpStatus` and retry using the oracle service’s retry strategy (if any).
- **timeouts / network errors:** treat as transient; retry with exponential backoff.

### Offline fallback strategy

When Chess.com is unreachable or rate-limited:
- **Do not submit** an on-chain result until a verified end-state is fetched.
- Mark the match as **pending verification** and retry later.
- If a verification attempt observes a game payload without a known terminal
  `end.result`, treat it as **GameNotFinished** and retry.

---

## Oracle Submission Rate Limiting

To prevent spam or denial-of-service against the on-chain oracle log, the
`OracleContract` enforces per-oracle submission limits on `submit_result` and
`submit_batch_results`:

| Limit | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Hourly | 100 submissions | Rolling 1-hour window |
| Daily | 1,000 submissions | Rolling 24-hour window |

A `submit_batch_results` call counts its full entry count against both limits
in a single check — e.g. a 40-entry batch consumes 40 units of quota. The
check runs before any storage writes, so a rejected call (whole batch or
single result) never partially succeeds and never consumes quota.

### Sliding window algorithm

Limits are tracked with a sliding-window counter rather than a naive fixed
window, so a burst spanning a window boundary can't double the effective
limit. Each window (hourly, daily) stores:

- `window_start` — the timestamp (`env.ledger().timestamp()`) the current
  window began,
- `current_count` — submissions recorded since `window_start`,
- `previous_count` — submissions recorded in the window immediately before.

The estimated count for rate-limit purposes is:

```
estimate = current_count + previous_count * (window_size - elapsed_in_current) / window_size
```

This weights the previous window's count by how much of it still falls inside
the trailing lookback period, giving an accurate approximation of a true
sliding window without storing a timestamp per submission.

### Admin configuration

The admin can override the default limits per oracle address:

```rust
oracle_client.set_oracle_rate_limits(&oracle_address, &hourly_limit, &daily_limit);
```

- Passing `0` for either field resets that field to the contract default
  (100/1000).
- `hourly_limit` must not exceed `daily_limit` (when both are non-zero), or
  the call returns `Error::InvalidRateLimit`.
- Emits an `oracle / ratelim` event with `(oracle, hourly_limit, daily_limit)`.

### Querying rate limit status

There is no HTTP layer on-chain, so instead of rate-limit response headers,
callers query current usage directly:

```rust
let status = oracle_client.get_oracle_rate_limit_status(&oracle_address);
// status.hourly_used / .hourly_limit / .hourly_remaining
// status.daily_used  / .daily_limit  / .daily_remaining

let limits = oracle_client.get_oracle_rate_limits(&oracle_address);
// limits.hourly_limit / .daily_limit
```

### Suspicious pattern alerts

Once an oracle's usage reaches **80%** of either its hourly or daily limit,
the contract emits an `oracle / alert` event with
`(oracle, window_label, used, limit)`, where `window_label` is `"hourly"` or
`"daily"`. Off-chain monitoring can subscribe to this event to page an admin
before the oracle is actually throttled.

### Errors

- `Error::RateLimitExceeded` (9) — the submission(s) would exceed the
  oracle's hourly or daily limit.
- `Error::InvalidRateLimit` (10) — `set_oracle_rate_limits` was called with
  `hourly_limit > daily_limit`.

---

## Result Deletion Policy (`delete_result`)

The oracle contract exposes a `delete_result` function that allows the admin to remove a previously submitted result from persistent storage:

```rust
oracle_client.delete_result(&match_id); // → Result<(), Error>
```

### Why it exists

On-chain persistent storage has a finite TTL (~30 days). In normal operation results expire naturally. `delete_result` exists for two narrow operational cases:

1. **Erroneous submission** — the oracle submitted a result for the wrong `match_id` (e.g., due to a bug or misconfiguration) before the escrow payout was triggered. Deletion allows the correct result to be re-submitted.
2. **Storage reclamation** — proactively freeing storage rent for results that are no longer needed (e.g., after a dispute is fully resolved off-chain).

---

## has_result vs has_result_admin

Both functions answer "has a result been submitted for this `match_id`?", but differ in access control:

| Function | Auth Required | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `has_result(match_id) -> bool` | None (public) | General-purpose polling by indexers, frontends, or the escrow contract's integrators. |
| `has_result_admin(match_id) -> Result<bool, Error>` | Admin (`require_auth`) | Private-tournament contexts where even the *existence* of a submitted result should not be observable by third parties before an official announcement. Returns `Error::Unauthorized` if the contract is uninitialized or the caller is not the admin. |

Both read the same underlying `DataKey::Result(match_id)` storage entry; `has_result_admin` adds an authorization gate in front of the identical lookup.

---

## Data Structures

The oracle contract's public `#[contracttype]` types, defined in `contracts/oracle/src/types.rs`:

### `ResultEntry`

Returned by `get_result(match_id)`.

---

## Swap Function (Token Exchange)

The `swap` function atomically exchanges `token_in` for `token_out` using a stored fixed-point exchange rate. It is intended for multi-token settlement and conversions.

### Function Signature

```rust
pub fn swap(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,          // Must authorize the swap
    token_in: Address,        // Token to provide (collected from caller)
    token_out: Address,       // Token to receive (dispensed from contract)
    amount_in: i128,          // Amount of token_in to provide (must be > 0)
    min_amount_out: i128,     // Minimum acceptable token_out (slippage floor)
    recipient: Address,       // Address to receive token_out
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

### Execution Flow (Atomic, Single Transaction)

1. **Authentication:** Verify `caller` has signed the transaction via `caller.require_auth()`.
2. **Input Validation:** Ensure `amount_in > 0`.
3. **Rate Lookup:** Find the exchange rate for `(token_in, token_out)` in either direction.
4. **Compute Output:** Calculate `amount_out` using the rate, scaled as `1e7`.
5. **Slippage Check:** Verify `amount_out ≥ min_amount_out`; abort if not.
6. **Collect Input:** Transfer `amount_in` of `token_in` from `caller` to the contract.
7. **Dispense Output:** Transfer `amount_out` of `token_out` from the contract to `recipient`.

If any step fails, the entire transaction is rolled back (no partial settlement).

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `caller` | `Address` | Yes | The account authorizing and funding the swap. Must sign the transaction. |
| `token_in` | `Address` | Yes | The contract address of the input token. |
| `token_out` | `Address` | Yes | The contract address of the output token. |
| `amount_in` | `i128` | Yes | Quantity of `token_in` to provide. Must be > 0. |
| `min_amount_out` | `i128` | Yes | Minimum acceptable `token_out` to receive. Caller's slippage floor. |
| `recipient` | `Address` | Yes | Address to receive `amount_out` of `token_out`. Can be `caller` or any other address. |

### Errors

| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Unauthorized` | Contract uninitialized, or insufficient admin stake. | Initialize and ensure oracle stakes exist. |
| `InvalidAmount` | `amount_in ≤ 0`. | Provide a positive `amount_in`. |
| `ResultNotFound` | No rate exists for `(token_in, token_out)` in either direction. | Admin must call `set_rate` to establish the rate. |
| `Overflow` | Numeric overflow during rate multiplication or division. | Use smaller `amount_in` or lower `rate`. |
| `SlippageExceeded` | Computed `amount_out < min_amount_out`. | Increase `min_amount_out` tolerance or wait for better rate. |

### Rate Directions

The contract stores rates bidirectionally:

- **Forward:** `set_rate(token_out, token_in, rate)` means "1 unit of `token_in` costs `rate / 1e7` units of `token_out`"
  ```
  amount_out = amount_in * rate / 1e7
  ```

- **Inverse:** `set_rate(token_in, token_out, rate)` means "1 unit of `token_out` costs `rate / 1e7` units of `token_in`"
  ```
  amount_out = amount_in * 1e7 / rate
  ```

### Examples

**Example 1: Simple exchange (1:1 rate)**

```rust
// Set rate: 1 USDC = 1 XLM
oracle_client.set_rate(&usdc_addr, &xlm_addr, &10_000_000);

// Swap 100 USDC for XLM (expecting ~100 XLM)
oracle_client.swap(
    &my_address,    // caller (must sign)
    &usdc_addr,     // token_in
    &xlm_addr,      // token_out
    &100,           // amount_in (100 USDC)
    &95,            // min_amount_out (accept 95–100 XLM, reject if <95)
    &my_address,    // recipient (me)
);
// Result: My balance increases by ~100 XLM, decreases by 100 USDC
```

**Example 2: Slippage protection (swapping to different recipient)**

```rust
// Rate: 1 ETH = 0.5 BTC
oracle_client.set_rate(&btc_addr, &eth_addr, &5_000_000);

// Swap 10 ETH for BTC, send to vault
oracle_client.swap(
    &my_address,      // caller (I pay)
    &eth_addr,        // token_in
    &btc_addr,        // token_out
    &10,              // amount_in (10 ETH)
    &4_500_000,       // min_amount_out (floor at 4.5 BTC; if <, fail)
    &vault_address,   // recipient (vault receives BTC)
);
// Result: I lose 10 ETH, vault gains ~5 BTC
```

**Example 3: Tight slippage (price-sensitive)**

```rust
// Rate: 1 GOLD = 0.01 SILVER
oracle_client.set_rate(&silver_addr, &gold_addr, &100_000);

// Swap 1000 SILVER for GOLD, accept only 9.99–10 GOLD
oracle_client.swap(
    &trader_address,
    &silver_addr,
    &gold_addr,
    &1000,
    &9_990_000,      // min_amount_out = 9.99 GOLD (0.01% slippage tolerance)
    &trader_address,
);
// If computed amount_out < 9.99, transaction fails without settling
```

### Security Properties

**1. Authorization Required**
- The `caller` must cryptographically sign the transaction.
- Without a valid signature, `swap` is rejected before any state changes.

**2. Atomic Settlement**
- Token input is collected **before** token output is dispensed.
- If the contract doesn't have sufficient `token_out` balance, the output transfer fails and the entire transaction is rolled back.
- No partial settlements (both-or-nothing).

**3. Slippage Protection**
- Caller specifies `min_amount_out`, enforced before settlement.
- If the rate has moved unfavorably (smaller payout), the transaction aborts.
- Protects against MEV, flash loans, and delayed execution.

**4. Reentrancy Safety**
- If `token_out` is a malicious contract with a callback hook, the callback fires during the output transfer (step 7).
- By that time, the input transfer is complete (step 6).
- The callback cannot re-enter `swap` and claim additional funds because the contract has already received the caller's `token_in`.
- Thus, no double-extraction or fund drain via reentrancy is possible.

### Admin Pricing Model

The contract uses **fixed exchange rates** set by the admin via `set_rate`:

```rust
pub fn set_rate(
    env: Env,
    token_a: Address,
    token_b: Address,
    rate: i128,       // Fixed-point rate, scaled 1e7
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Deterministic and auditable
- ✅ No external oracle dependency
- ✅ Instant (no latency)
- ✅ Admin has full control

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Static (doesn't respond to market changes)
- ❌ No staleness bounds (rate can be arbitrarily old)
- ❌ No deviation checks (admin can set unreasonable rates)

**Future Enhancements (v1.1+):**
- Oracle-fed rates from an external price feed
- Staleness checks (e.g., reject if rate is >1 hour old)
- Deviation bounds (e.g., reject if rate changed >10% since last update)
- Multi-provider fallback and consensus

### Use Cases

1. **Multi-token escrow settlement:** If a match is funded in one token but requires payout in another, use `swap` to convert.
2. **Cross-asset tournaments:** Players deposit in different stablecoins; `swap` unifies payouts to a single token.
3. **Liquidity protocol:** The contract can mediate token exchanges with stored rates.

### Not Recommended For

- **High-frequency trading:** Rates are static; no real-time market response.
- **Large swaps:** Slippage protection is caller-specified (not algorithmic); large swaps may breach tolerance.
- **Volatile pairs:** Fixed rates quickly become stale; consider oracle-fed rates instead.

## Contract Function Reference

The complete public function surface of `OracleContract` (`contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs`). Functions above with dedicated sections are cross-referenced rather than re-described.

| Function | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | `(admin: Address)` | One-time setup; stores the admin address. Panics-free — returns `Error::AlreadyInitialized` on a second call. |
| `is_initialized` | `() -> bool` | Returns whether `initialize` has been called. |
| `register_oracle_with_stake` | `(oracle_address: Address, stake_amount: i128, token: Address)` | Transfers `stake_amount` of `token` from `oracle_address` into the contract as a slashable bond, recorded in `OracleRegistration`. |
| `slash_oracle` | `(oracle_address: Address, slash_amount: i128)` | Admin-only. Deducts `slash_amount` from a registered oracle's stake and transfers it to the admin. |
| `submit_result` | `(match_id: u64, game_id: String, platform: Platform, result: Winner)` | See [Submitting a Result](#submitting-a-result). Admin-authorized, rate-limited, one result per `match_id`. |
| `submit_batch_results` | `(entries: Vec<BatchResultEntry>)` | All-or-nothing submission of up to `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (100) results in one call; each entry counts toward the submitting admin's rate limit. |
| `get_result` | `(match_id: u64) -> ResultEntry` | Returns the stored result, or `Error::ResultNotFound`. Extends the entry's TTL on read. |
| `has_result` | `(match_id: u64) -> bool` | Public existence check. See [has_result vs has_result_admin](#has_result-vs-has_result_admin). |
| `has_result_admin` | `(match_id: u64) -> Result<bool, Error>` | Admin-gated existence check. See [has_result vs has_result_admin](#has_result-vs-has_result_admin). |
| `delete_result` | `(match_id: u64)` | Admin-only, irreversible. See [Result Deletion Policy](#result-deletion-policy-delete_result). |
| `get_admin` | `() -> Address` | Returns the stored admin address, or `Error::Unauthorized` if uninitialized. |
| `update_admin` | `(new_admin: Address)` | Rotates the admin address. Requires current admin auth. |
| `pause` | `()` | Admin-only. Blocks `submit_result` and `submit_batch_results` while paused (`delete_result` is also blocked; see [Security: Oracle Contract Pause](security.md#oracle-contract-pause)). |
| `unpause` | `()` | Admin-only. Reverses `pause`. |
| `set_oracle_rate_limits` | `(oracle: Address, hourly_limit: u32, daily_limit: u32)` | Admin-only. Overrides the default hourly/daily submission caps for one oracle address. Pass `0` for either field to reset that field to the contract default. |
| `get_oracle_rate_limits` | `(oracle: Address) -> RateLimitConfig` | Returns the effective (override or default) rate-limit configuration for `oracle`. |
| `get_oracle_rate_limit_status` | `(oracle: Address) -> RateLimitStatus` | Returns `oracle`'s current sliding-window usage and remaining quota. |
| `set_rate` | `(token_a: Address, token_b: Address, rate: i128)` | Admin-only. Stores a fixed-point exchange rate (scaled `1e7`) between `token_a` and `token_b`, used by `swap` for atomic token conversion. |
| `get_rate` | `(token_a: Address, token_b: Address) -> i128` | Public query. Returns the rate previously stored by `set_rate` for the ordered pair, or `Error::ResultNotFound` if none has been set. |
| `swap` | `(caller: Address, token_in: Address, token_out: Address, amount_in: i128, min_amount_out: i128, recipient: Address)` | Atomically exchanges `amount_in` of `token_in` (collected from `caller`) for `token_out` (dispensed to `recipient`) using a stored rate. Requires `caller` authorization and enforces slippage protection via `min_amount_out`. See [Swap Function](#swap-function-token-exchange) for complete details. |
| `get_cached_result` | `(game_id: String, platform: Platform) -> Option<(Winner, u64)>` | Returns `Some((result, expiry_timestamp))` for a non-expired cache entry, or `None` if missing or expired (an expired entry is also removed from storage as a side effect). |
| `invalidate_cache` | `(game_id: String, platform: Platform)` | Removes any cached result for `(game_id, platform)`, forcing the next lookup to miss. |
| `get_slashing_grace_period` | `() -> u32` | Returns the configured slashing grace period in ledgers (the window between `slash_oracle` staging and `finalize_slash` execution). Returns `0` if never set. |
| `finalize_slash` | `(oracle_address: Address, match_id: u64) -> Result<(), Error>` | Admin-only. Executes a previously staged slash once the grace period has elapsed (`env.ledger().sequence() >= eligible_ledger`). Deducts `slash_amount` from the oracle's registered stake and transfers it to the admin. Returns `Error::SlashNotFound` if no pending slash exists, or `Error::SlashGracePeriodNotElapsed` if called too early. |
| `admin_cancel_slash` | `(oracle_address: Address, match_id: u64) -> Result<(), Error>` | Admin-only. Cancels a pending slash before it is finalized, removing the `PendingSlash` record entirely. Governance intervention point during the grace period. Returns `Error::SlashNotFound` if no pending slash exists. |
| `get_pending_slash` | `(oracle_address: Address, match_id: u64) -> Option<PendingSlash>` | Returns the staged `PendingSlash` for `(oracle_address, match_id)` if one exists, or `None`. Used by tooling and the oracle slash relay to inspect grace-period state. |
| `get_all_oracles_paginated` | `(offset: u32, limit: u32) -> Vec<Address>` | Returns a paginated slice of all registered oracle addresses (capped at 100 per call). Use `offset` and `limit` to iterate without unbounded reads. Returns an empty `Vec` when `offset` is beyond the end of the set. |
| `get_consensus_state` | `(match_id: u64) -> Option<ConsensusState>` | Returns the current multi-oracle consensus voting record for `match_id`, or `None` if no consensus round has been started for that match. |
| `get_oracle_submissions` | `(oracle: Address, offset: u32, limit: u32) -> Vec<OracleSubmissionEntry>` | Returns a paginated slice of the submission history for `oracle`, ordered oldest to newest (capped at 100 per call). Returns an empty `Vec` when `offset` is beyond the end of the list or the oracle has never submitted a result. |

## Troubleshooting

> **Comprehensive troubleshooting guide:** For a full operator runbook covering
> dead-letter backlog, RPC connectivity, Lichess/Chess.com API errors, stale
> game IDs, and replay commands, see
> [docs/oracle-troubleshooting.md](oracle-troubleshooting.md).

### Rate limit exceeded (`RateLimitExceeded`)

**Symptom:** `submit_result` or `submit_batch_results` returns
`Error(Contract, #9)`.

**Cause:** The oracle has exhausted its hourly (100) or daily (1,000)
submission quota on the `OracleContract`.

**Fix:**
- Wait until the rolling window resets (up to 1 hour for hourly, 24 hours for
  daily).
- Query current usage before retrying:
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ORACLE \
    -- get_oracle_rate_limit_status --oracle <ORACLE_ADDRESS>
  ```
- If the default limits are too low for your workload, the admin can raise
  them:
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ORACLE \
    --source <ORACLE_ADMIN_KEYPAIR> \
    -- set_oracle_rate_limits \
    --oracle <ORACLE_ADDRESS> \
    --hourly_limit 500 \
    --daily_limit 5000
  ```

### API key invalid / authentication failure

**Symptom:** The off-chain oracle service logs `401 Unauthorized` or
`403 Forbidden` when calling the chess platform API.

**Cause:** `LICHESS_API_TOKEN` or `CHESSDOTCOM_API_KEY` in `.env` is missing,
expired, or incorrect.

**Fix:**
1. Re-generate or copy the correct key from your Lichess/Chess.com developer
   account.
2. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   LICHESS_API_TOKEN=lip_xxxxxxxxxxxx
   CHESSDOTCOM_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
3. Restart the oracle service. No on-chain changes are required.

---

### Game not finished yet (`GameNotFinished`)

**Symptom:** The oracle service logs `GameNotFinished` and does not submit a
result; the match stays `Active` on-chain.

**Cause:** The chess platform API returned a game payload without a terminal
`end.result` field — the game is still in progress.

**Fix:** This is expected behaviour. The oracle will retry automatically. No
manual intervention is needed unless the game has genuinely ended but the
platform API is lagging. In that case:
- Wait a few minutes and allow the retry backoff to resolve it.
- If the platform API continues to show the game as in progress after it has
  clearly ended, contact the platform's support or wait for the result to
  propagate (usually < 5 minutes).

---

### Network timeout / chess platform unreachable

**Symptom:** Oracle service logs `timeout`, `connection refused`, or
`HttpStatus` errors; no result is submitted on-chain.

**Cause:** The chess platform API is temporarily unreachable, or the 30-second
HTTP timeout was exceeded.

**Fix:**
- The oracle will not submit a result until a verified end-state is confirmed.
  Retry is automatic with exponential backoff.
- Check the platform's status page ([lichess.org/status](https://lichess.org/status)
  or [chess.com](https://www.chess.com)) for ongoing incidents.
- Verify outbound connectivity from the oracle host:
  ```bash
  curl -I https://lichess.org/game/export/abcd1234
  curl -I https://api.chess.com/pub/game/123456789
  ```
- If the oracle host is behind a firewall, ensure outbound HTTPS (port 443) is
  open to the chess platform domains.

---

### Oracle not submitting results (wrong oracle address configured)

**Symptom:** `submit_result` returns `UnauthorizedOracle`; the transaction is
signed by the oracle keypair but still rejected.

**Cause:** The escrow contract's stored oracle address does not match the
keypair the oracle service is using.

**Fix:** Check which address the escrow contract has on record:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ESCROW -- get_oracle
```
Compare this to the oracle service's configured keypair address. If they
differ, either:
- Update the oracle service's keypair to match the on-chain address, or
- Rotate the on-chain oracle address (requires escrow admin):
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ESCROW \
    --source <ESCROW_ADMIN_KEYPAIR> \
    -- update_oracle \
    --new_oracle <CORRECT_ORACLE_ADDRESS>
  ```
