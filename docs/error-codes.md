# Smart Contract Error Codes Reference

**Last updated:** 2026-08-27 · **Verified against:** `contracts/escrow/src/errors.rs` and `contracts/oracle/src/errors.rs`

This document is the exhaustive, user-facing reference for every error a
caller can receive from the two on-chain Soroban contracts in this repo:

- [`EscrowContract`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) — [`contracts/escrow/src/errors.rs`](../contracts/escrow/src/errors.rs) (50 variants)
- [`OracleContract`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) — [`contracts/oracle/src/errors.rs`](../contracts/oracle/src/errors.rs) (21 variants)

Every variant defined in those two files is documented below. If you add,
remove, or renumber a variant, update this file in the same PR.

## How errors are returned

Both contracts use Soroban's `#[contracterror]` macro. An error is **not** a
string — it's a small integer (`u32`) discriminant attached to the function's
`Result<T, Error>`. When a call fails, the CLI/SDK surfaces it as something
like:

```
Error(Contract, #4)
```

`#4` is the numeric code from the tables below. Map it back to a name using
this document, then look up the cause and recovery steps.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID -- deposit \
  --match_id 42 --player <ADDRESS>
# ... Error(Contract, #4) ...
# → 4 = Unauthorized (see Escrow table below)
```

## Security: what error codes do (and don't) reveal

- The on-chain error is **only** the numeric discriminant — no message text,
  stack trace, storage contents, or argument values are ever included in the
  contract's return value. This is enforced by `#[contracterror]` itself, not
  by application logic, so there is no on-chain string to accidentally leak.
- Several variants are intentionally coarse-grained for this reason. For
  example, `Unauthorized` is returned both when the contract has never been
  initialized **and** when the caller is simply the wrong account — this
  avoids confirming or denying internal state (e.g. "does this contract have
  an admin set?") to an unauthenticated caller.
- **Off-chain consumers (frontend, oracle-service, support tooling) are the
  place sensitive detail can leak.** When mapping these codes to user-facing
  UI text, do not embed request payloads, private keys, raw RPC responses, or
  internal match data in the displayed message — surface only the code, name,
  and the generic recovery guidance from this document.

---

## Recoverable vs. fatal

- **Recoverable** — the caller (player, admin, or oracle) can take a concrete
  action — fix input, wait, switch signer, or call a different function —
  and the same operation will succeed afterward. No funds or state are lost.
- **Fatal** — the error indicates an invariant violation or a hard
  arithmetic/storage limit. There is no client-side retry that fixes it; it
  requires investigation, an admin/dev intervention, or in the worst case
  means that specific match is stuck (other matches are unaffected).

## Escrow Contract (`contracts/escrow/src/errors.rs`)

### Recoverable errors

| Code | Name | Thrown By | Cause | Recovery | Example |
|------|------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | `MatchNotFound` | [`deposit`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`submit_result`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`cancel_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`expire_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`get_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`is_funded`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`get_depositor_count`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`get_escrow_balance`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `match_id` has no stored `Match` — wrong ID, typo, or wrong contract/network. | Call `get_match_count` to confirm the valid ID range, or `get_player_matches_paginated` to re-fetch a player's real match IDs. Double-check `$ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID` and `--network`. | `get_match --match_id 999` on a contract with only 50 matches → `#1`. |
| 2 | `AlreadyFunded` | [`deposit`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | The same player called `deposit` twice for one match. | No funds are at risk — the second call is simply rejected. Call `get_depositor_count` first if unsure whether you've already deposited. | Player1 deposits, then accidentally retries the same tx after a slow confirmation → `#2` on the retry; original deposit is untouched. |
| 3 | `NotFunded` | [`submit_result`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) (incl. via [`submit_result_with_oracle_record`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs)) | Result submission was attempted before both players deposited. | Wait for both deposits; poll `is_funded` or `get_depositor_count` before asking the oracle to submit. | Oracle submits a result the moment a game finishes, but Player2 never funded the escrow → `#3`. |
| 4 | `Unauthorized` | [`pause`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`unpause`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`add_allowed_token`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`remove_allowed_token`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`deposit`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`submit_result`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`cancel_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`get_admin`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`get_oracle`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`set_match_timeout`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`propose_admin`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`accept_admin`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`update_oracle`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`transfer_admin`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | Caller isn't the required signer (admin/oracle/depositing player) **or** the contract hasn't been `initialize`d yet (admin/oracle key absent in storage). | Re-sign with the correct keypair, or call `initialize` first on a fresh deployment. Use `is_initialized` to tell the two cases apart safely. | Calling `pause` with a non-admin key → `#4`. Calling `get_admin` on a contract that was never initialized → also `#4`. |
| 4 | `NotAdmin` *(sub-case of `Unauthorized`)* | [`pause`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`unpause`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`add_allowed_token`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`remove_allowed_token`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`set_match_timeout`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`propose_admin`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`accept_admin`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`update_oracle`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`transfer_admin`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | The caller is not the configured admin address. Surfaces as `Error(Contract, #4)`. The contract does not use a separate `NotAdmin` variant — `Unauthorized` covers all authorization failures to keep callers from probing whether an admin is set. | Verify the signing key matches the admin returned by `get_admin`. If the contract is uninitialized, call `initialize` first (check with `is_initialized`). To rotate the admin, the *current* admin must call `propose_admin`/`accept_admin` or `transfer_admin`. | Calling `pause` with a non-admin keypair → `Error(Contract, #4)`. |
| 4 | `NotOracle` *(sub-case of `Unauthorized`)* | [`submit_result`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`submit_result_with_oracle_record`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | The caller is not the configured oracle address. Surfaces as `Error(Contract, #4)`. Like `NotAdmin`, the contract returns the same `Unauthorized` code to avoid leaking internal state to unauthenticated callers. | Verify the signing key matches the oracle returned by `get_oracle`. If the oracle address needs updating, the admin must call `update_oracle` with the correct new address. If the contract is uninitialized, call `initialize` first. | Oracle service running with a rotated keypair that no longer matches the on-chain oracle address → `Error(Contract, #4)` on every `submit_result` call. |
| 5 | `InvalidState` | [`deposit`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`submit_result`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`cancel_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`expire_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | The match isn't in the lifecycle state the function requires (e.g. depositing into a `Completed` match, submitting a result for a non-`Active` match). | Call `get_match` and check the `state` field before retrying the action. | Calling `submit_result` on a match already `Completed` → `#5`. |
| 7 | `AlreadyInitialized` | [`initialize`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `initialize` was called a second time. | No action needed — the contract is already configured. Use `get_admin`/`get_oracle` to confirm current config instead of re-initializing. | Re-running a deploy script that calls `initialize` unconditionally → `#7` on the second run. |
| 9 | `ContractPaused` | [`create_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`deposit`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`submit_result`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`submit_result_with_oracle_record`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | **Either** the admin called `pause` (contract-wide block, affects everyone), **or** the caller (or, for `create_match` variants, either named player) is on the admin-managed per-player freeze list (`admin_freeze_player`) — a targeted block that affects only that player. The error enum is at its 50-variant XDR cap, so the frozen-player case reuses this code rather than adding a new one (mirroring how the token blacklist reuses `TokenNotAllowed`). | Contract-wide pause: wait for the admin to call `unpause`; poll `is_paused`. Player freeze: the player must wait for an admin to call `admin_unfreeze_player`; check `is_player_frozen` / `get_frozen_players`. A freeze never blocks fund recovery — `cancel_match`, `expire_match`, and `claim_vested_payout` remain available. | `create_match` during an incident-response pause → `#9` until `unpause`. A frozen player calling `deposit` → `#9` until `admin_unfreeze_player`. |
| 10 | `InvalidAmount` | [`create_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `stake_amount <= 0`, or `stake_amount` is below the admin-configured `minimum_stake` (see `set_minimum_stake`; defaults to `1`). | Resubmit with a positive `stake_amount` that meets `get_protocol_config().minimum_stake`. | `create_match` with `stake_amount = 0` → `#10`. `set_minimum_stake(50)` then `create_match` with `stake_amount = 10` → `#10`. |
| 13 | `DuplicateGameId` | [`create_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `game_id` was already used by a previous match (each game maps to exactly one escrow match, to prevent oracle replay across matches). | Use a fresh, unique `game_id`, or look up the existing match instead of creating a new one. | Two players try to escrow the same Lichess game URL twice → second `create_match` gets `#13`. |
### 14. MatchNotExpired

| Code | Name | Since | Thrown By | Cause | Recovery | Example |
|------|------|-------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| 14 | `MatchNotExpired` | v0.1.0 | [`expire_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `expire_match` was called before `current_ledger - created_ledger >= timeout`. | Wait until the configured timeout elapses. Check `get_match_timeout` and the match's `created_ledger` (via `get_match`) to compute the earliest valid ledger. **Note:** This timeout is the primary safety mechanism protecting players if the oracle goes offline — see [FAQ: What happens if the oracle goes offline?](faq.md#9-what-happens-if-the-oracle-goes-offline) | Calling `expire_match` one day into a 30-day default timeout → `#14`. |
| 15 | `InvalidGameId` | v0.1.0 | [`create_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `game_id` is empty or longer than 64 bytes. | Pass a valid Lichess (8-char alphanumeric) or Chess.com (numeric) game ID under the 64-byte limit. | `create_match` with `game_id = ""` → `#15`. |
| 16 | `InvalidPlayers` | v0.1.0 | [`create_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `player1 == player2`, or `player2` is the escrow contract's own address. | Supply two distinct, real player addresses. | `create_match` where both players are the same wallet → `#16`. |
| 17 | `TokenNotAllowed` | v0.1.0 | [`create_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`create_match_with_conversion`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`create_match_with_referrer`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | Either the token allowlist is active (at least one token was ever added) and the supplied token isn't on it, or the token (or, for conversion matches, either token) is on the admin-managed blacklist (`add_token_to_blacklist`) — checked first and takes precedence over allowlist status. | Admin must call `add_allowed_token` for that token, or the caller should pick an already-allowed one via `get_allowed_tokens`; if blacklisted, use a different token or have admin call `remove_token_from_blacklist`. | `create_match` with an unlisted custom token after the admin enabled allowlisting, or with a token an admin previously blacklisted for fraud (rejected even if it's also on the allowlist) → `#17`. |
| 18 | `InvalidAddress` | v0.1.0 | [`initialize`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), [`update_oracle`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | The `oracle`/`new_oracle` address equals the escrow contract's own address. | Supply a distinct external account or contract address. | `initialize` called with `oracle = <ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID itself>` → `#18`. |
| 19 | `MatchAlreadyActive` | v0.1.0 | [`cancel_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `cancel_match` was called on a match that's already `Active` (both players deposited) — voluntary cancellation is pre-activation only. | Let the match proceed to `submit_result`, or wait for `expire_match` eligibility if it stalls. Active matches cannot be cancelled by players. | A player tries to back out after both stakes are in → `#19`. |
| 20 | `InvalidTimeout` | v0.1.0 | [`set_match_timeout`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | `seconds` is outside `[86,400, 7,776,000]` (1–90 days, wall-clock seconds). | Pass a timeout within the 1–90 day range, in seconds. Use `MIN_MATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 86,400` (1 day) and `MAX_MATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 7,776,000` (90 days) as bounds. | `set_match_timeout` with `seconds = 100` (≈1.5 minutes) → `#20`. |
| 21 | `SnapshotNotFound` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) (ledger snapshot verification) | An internal ledger snapshot required to verify the oracle's result proof is not available — typically when the result is submitted too far in the past (TTL expired) or ledger data was purged. | Resubmit the result sooner after the game finishes. Ensure oracle service processes results within a few hours of completion, not days later. | Oracle attempts to verify a result 1+ months after the game ended → `#21` (ledger snapshot purged). |

### Fatal errors

| Code | Name | Since | Thrown By | Cause | Recovery | Example |
|------|------|-------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| 6 | `AlreadyExists` | v0.1.0 | [`create_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | A `Match` already exists at the storage slot for the *next* sequential match ID before `create_match` assigns it. Under normal operation `MatchCount` is the sole source of the next ID, so this should never trigger. | Not client-recoverable. Indicates storage/state corruption or a bug in ID assignment — requires admin/dev investigation; in the worst case, a contract migration. | Would only be observed after manual storage tampering or a contract bug — not reachable via the public API in current code. |
| 8 | `Overflow` | v0.1.0 | [`add_allowed_token`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) (token counter), [`create_match`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) (match counter), [`submit_result`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) (`stake_amount * 2`) | An arithmetic guard (`checked_add`/`checked_mul`) tripped: a counter hit `u32`/`u64::MAX`, or `stake_amount` is large enough that doubling it overflows `i128`. | Counter overflow isn't realistically recoverable (would require billions of matches/tokens) short of a contract upgrade. Pot overflow is **fatal for that one match only** — it must be guarded against at `create_match` time by capping `stake_amount` well under `i128::MAX / 2`; once such a match exists, `submit_result` will always revert, so the only path forward is `cancel_match`/`expire_match` to return the deposits. | A match created with `stake_amount` near `i128::MAX / 2` will permanently fail `submit_result` with `#8` — recover player funds via `expire_match` instead. |

| 11 | *(reserved)* | — | — | **Code 11 is a reserved gap.** The `RollbackWindowExpired` variant that previously occupied this slot was removed when the `dispute_and_rollback_match` feature was refactored. No current contract function returns `#11`. If your SDK surfaces this code it indicates you are talking to an older contract version. Treat it as an `UnknownContractError` until the slot is re-assigned in a future release. | N/A | A stale integration built against an older ABI may surface `#11` — upgrade to the current contract version. |
| 12 | *(reserved)* | — | — | **Code 12 is a reserved gap.** The `ReasonTooLong` variant that previously occupied this slot was removed in the same refactor as `#11`. No current contract function returns `#12`. Treat it as `UnknownContractError`. See the **50-variant XDR ceiling** note at the top of this section — reserved codes may be re-assigned when a slot is needed for a new feature. | N/A | A stale integration built against an older ABI may surface `#12` — upgrade to the current contract version. |

**Note on `platform`:** `create_match` takes `platform: Platform`, a typed enum (`Platform::Lichess` / `Platform::ChessDotCom`). Because it's a typed enum rather than a free-form string, an invalid platform value is rejected by the contract ABI itself (an unrecognized discriminant fails to deserialize) before the call ever reaches contract code — there is no "unknown platform" case for the contract to return a typed error for.

### New error codes (22+) — Dispute resolution, vesting, tiers, and upgrades

These error codes support advanced features including dispute resolution, staking tiers, vesting schedules, and contract upgrades:

| Code | Name | Since | Thrown By | Cause | Recovery | Example |
|------|------|-------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| 22 | `VestingNotExpired` | v0.1.0 | Vesting check functions | Attempting to claim vested payout before the vesting period elapses | Wait until the vesting period expires, then retry the claim | Calling `claim_vested_payout` before the configured vesting duration has passed → `#22`. |
| 23 | `AlreadyClaimed` | v0.1.0 | Payout claim functions | A player has already claimed their payout for this match | No action needed — the payout was already received. Check account balance or transaction history to confirm. | Player1 calls `claim_vested_payout` twice for the same match → `#23` on the second call. |
| 24 | `DisputeNotFound` | v0.1.0 | Dispute resolution functions | Attempting to resolve or query a dispute that doesn't exist | Confirm the dispute ID exists via the dispute listing functions | Admin calls `resolve_disputed_match` with an invalid dispute ID → `#24`. |
| 25 | `PendingResultNotFound` | v0.1.0 | Dispute functions | No pending result exists for the match yet | Submit a result first before initiating a dispute | Attempting to dispute a match that has no oracle result submitted → `#25`. |
| 26 | `DisputeAlreadyResolved` | v0.1.0 | Dispute functions | The dispute has already been resolved by the admin | No further action needed — the resolution is final | Attempting to vote or resolve a dispute that's already been settled → `#26`. |
| 27 | `VotingPeriodElapsed` | v0.1.0 | Oracle voting functions | The voting window for this consensus vote has closed | Wait for the next voting round or submit through a different path | Attempting to vote on an oracle result after the voting period ended → `#27`. |
| 28 | `AlreadyVoted` | v0.1.0 | Oracle voting functions | The oracle has already cast a vote on this match | No action needed — vote is already recorded. To change a vote, resubmit a different result. | An oracle calls `submit_oracle_result` with a different winner after already voting → `#28` (equivocation). |
| 29 | `NotStaker` | v0.1.0 | Staking/tier functions | Caller is not a registered staker or doesn't meet tier requirements | Register with the staking system or deposit the minimum tier amount | Non-staked player attempts to participate in a tier-restricted match → `#29`. |
| 30 | `VotingPeriodNotElapsed` | v0.1.0 | Dispute resolution | Attempting to finalize consensus before the voting window closes | Wait for the voting period to fully elapse | Calling `finalize_consensus` before all oracles have had time to vote → `#30`. |
| 31 | `MatchNotInPendingResult` | v0.1.0 | Dispute functions | The match is not in the "pending result" state required for disputes | Confirm the match has a submitted result but is not yet finalized | Attempting to dispute a match in `Completed` state → `#31`. |
| 32 | `DisputePeriodNotElapsed` | v0.1.0 | Dispute resolution | Attempting to finalize a dispute before the dispute window closes | Wait for the dispute period to expire | Admin tries to resolve a dispute too soon → `#32`. |
| 33 | `DisputeAlreadyRaised` | v0.1.0 | Dispute creation | A dispute has already been raised for this match | No action needed — one dispute is already in progress. Monitor the resolution process. | Attempting to raise a second dispute for the same match → `#33`. |
| 34 | `InvalidEvidenceHash` | v0.1.0 | Dispute functions | The evidence hash format is invalid or missing | Provide a valid cryptographic hash of the dispute evidence | Submitting evidence with a malformed or incorrectly-sized hash → `#34`. |
| 35 | `TierStakeNotAllowed` | v0.1.0 | Match creation with tiers | Stake amount doesn't align with player tier requirements | Adjust stake to match the player's tier bracket, or upgrade tier by staking more | Player in Tier 1 (1–100 XLM) tries to create a match with 500 XLM stake → `#35`. |
| 36 | `NotInitialized` | v0.1.0 | Read functions on uninitialized contract | Contract has not been initialized yet | Call `initialize` first (admin must do this after deployment) | Calling `get_admin` before `initialize` on a fresh contract → `#36`. |
| 37 | `InvalidPauseState` | v0.1.0 | Pause/unpause functions | Attempting to pause an already-paused contract or unpause a running one | Check current pause state via `is_paused` before calling pause/unpause | Calling `pause` when contract is already paused → `#37`. |
| 38 | *(reserved)* | — | — | **Code 38 is a reserved gap.** The `InvalidConversionRate` variant that previously occupied this slot was removed when conversion-rate validation was consolidated into `#39 ConversionRateOutOfBounds`. No current contract function returns `#38`. Treat it as `UnknownContractError`. The escrow enum is at the XDR-enforced 50-variant ceiling — this slot may be re-used if a future feature requires a new error code. | N/A | A stale SDK or ABI snapshot may surface `#38` — update to the current contract interface. |
| 39 | `ConversionRateOutOfBounds` | v0.1.0 | Swap/token rate functions | The conversion rate exceeds acceptable bounds (typically ±5% of oracle rate) | Resubmit with a rate within tolerance, or wait for oracle to refresh | Submitting a swap rate 10% higher than the oracle rate when only ±5% is allowed → `#39`. |
| 40 | `ConversionRateStalePriceSource` | v0.1.0 | Rate validation | The price source used for rate validation is stale (too old) | Refresh the price feed from the oracle and retry | Attempting a swap using a price quote older than the configured TTL → `#40`. |
| 41 | `InsufficientBond` | v0.1.0 | Bond/stake system | Caller hasn't posted the required bond for the operation | Post the minimum bond amount and retry | Attempting a dispute without having posted the bond → `#41`. |
| 42 | `QuorumNotMet` | v0.1.0 | Consensus functions | Consensus voting hasn't reached the required quorum | Wait for more oracles to vote | Attempting to finalize consensus before enough oracles have voted → `#42`. |
| 43 | `InsufficientHoldingDuration` | v0.1.0 | Tier/staking functions | Staked tokens don't meet the minimum holding-period requirement | Wait longer, or unstake and re-stake to reset the timer | Player tries to use tier benefits before their stake has been locked for the required time → `#43`. |
| 44 | *(reserved)* | — | — | **Code 44 is a reserved gap.** The `OracleSlashFailed` variant that previously occupied this slot was removed when oracle slashing logic was redesigned. No current contract function returns `#44`. Treat it as `UnknownContractError`. | N/A | A stale integration may surface `#44` — upgrade to the current contract version. |
| 45 | `TooManyActiveMatches` | v0.1.0 | Match creation | The player has exceeded the maximum concurrent active matches | Wait for some existing matches to complete/cancel | Player with 50 active matches tries to create a 51st → `#45`. |
| 46 | `NotStablecoin` | v0.1.0 | Match creation (stablecoin-only mode) | Token is not a registered stablecoin and stablecoin-only mode is enabled | Use a stablecoin token (e.g., USDC, EURC) or have admin disable stablecoin-only mode | Creating a match with a non-stablecoin token when the contract is in stablecoin-only mode → `#46`. |
| 47 | `UpgradeNotScheduled` | v0.1.0 | Contract upgrade functions | Attempting to execute an upgrade that hasn't been scheduled | Schedule the upgrade first via the admin upgrade functions | Calling `execute_upgrade` without a prior `schedule_upgrade` → `#47`. |
| 48 | `UpgradeReviewPeriodNotElapsed` | v0.1.0 | Contract upgrade | Attempting to execute an upgrade before the review/delay period expires | Wait for the configured review window to pass | Trying to execute an upgrade 1 hour after scheduling when the minimum is 24 hours → `#48`. |
| 49 | `InvalidVersion` | v0.1.0 | Contract upgrade | The contract version specified in the upgrade is invalid or doesn't exist | Supply a valid contract version identifier | Scheduling an upgrade to a version that doesn't exist → `#49`. |
| 50 | `UpgradeAlreadyScheduled` | v0.1.0 | Contract upgrade | An upgrade is already scheduled; only one upgrade can be pending at a time | Execute or cancel the existing scheduled upgrade first | Attempting to schedule a second upgrade while one is already pending → `#50`. |
| 51 | `OracleAlreadyConfirmed` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result_with_oracle_record`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | The oracle has already submitted a confirmation for this match. Each match can only be confirmed once to prevent double-settlement. | Check `has_result` before submitting again. If a correction is genuinely required, admin must intervene — the oracle confirmation is immutable by design. | Oracle service retries after a network timeout, not realizing the first attempt landed → `#51` on retry. |
| 52 | `ConflictingResult` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result_with_oracle_record`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | The oracle submitted a result that conflicts with a previously recorded majority result. | Do not attempt to submit a different result — the on-chain majority result is authoritative. If the game outcome was genuinely wrong, raise a dispute through the governance process. | Oracle reports Player2 wins for a match where the majority consensus already recorded Player1 wins → `#52`. |
| 53 | *(reserved)* | — | — | **Code 53 is a reserved gap** between `ConflictingResult` (#52) and `NotAnOracle` (#54). No current contract function returns `#53`. The escrow enum is at the XDR-enforced 50-variant ceiling (`ScSpecUdtErrorEnumV0::cases` is a `VecM<_, 50>`) — this slot can only be filled when another variant is removed. Treat any `#53` you receive as `UnknownContractError` until it is formally assigned. | N/A | No current code path produces `#53`. |
| 54 | `NotAnOracle` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result_with_oracle_record`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), oracle-gated functions | The caller is not a registered oracle address. Distinct from `Unauthorized` (#4) — `#54` is returned specifically when the caller has valid auth credentials but is not on the oracle registry. | Verify the signing key is a registered oracle address via `get_oracle_address`. If the oracle address was rotated, admin must call `update_oracle` with the current key. | A new oracle instance with a fresh key pair submits a result without first having the admin register it via `update_oracle` → `#54`. |
| 55 | `DepositInProgress` | v0.1.0 | [`deposit`](../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs) | A deposit for this match is already in progress — the reentrancy guard tripped. A concurrent or re-entrant deposit call attempted to deposit while another deposit for the same match was still executing. | Do not submit multiple concurrent deposit calls for the same match ID. Retry after the first call completes. | Two parallel oracle service instances both call `deposit` for match 42 at the same time → one succeeds, the other gets `#55`. |

> **50-variant XDR ceiling:** Soroban's `#[contracterror]` macro serializes error enums via XDR, which caps the variant count at 50 (`ScSpecUdtErrorEnumV0::cases` is a `VecM<_, 50>`). The escrow `Error` enum is currently at that cap. Adding a new error variant requires either repurposing a reserved slot (11, 12, 38, 44, or 53) or removing a superseded variant first. This is why several recent features (player freeze, token blacklist) reuse existing error codes rather than introducing new ones.

## Oracle Contract (`contracts/oracle/src/errors.rs`)

All 22 variants are primarily recoverable — the majority represent client-side issues or rate limit exceedances, though a few indicate internal oracle stake/consensus state requiring investigation.

| Code | Name | Since | Thrown By | Cause | Recovery | Example |
|------|------|-------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | `Unauthorized` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_batch_results`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`has_result_admin`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`delete_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`update_admin`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`pause`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`unpause`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`set_oracle_rate_limits`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`register_oracle_with_stake`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | Caller isn't the configured admin, or the contract hasn't been `initialize`d (admin key absent). | Re-sign with the correct admin keypair, or call `initialize` first. Use `is_initialized` to distinguish the two cases. | `submit_result` signed by a non-admin oracle service key → `#1`. |
| 2 | `AlreadySubmitted` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_batch_results`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | A result for `match_id` is already stored — results are immutable once recorded (integrity guard). | Check `has_result`/`get_result` before submitting. If a genuine correction is needed, admin must `delete_result` first, then resubmit. | The oracle service retries a submission after a network timeout, not realizing the first attempt actually landed → `#2` on the retry (safe — no duplicate result is written). |
| 3 | `ResultNotFound` | v0.1.0 | [`get_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`delete_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | No result exists for `match_id` — never submitted, wrong ID, or the persistent entry's TTL expired and was purged. | Confirm `match_id`, check `has_result` to see if it was ever submitted, or submit the result if it's genuinely missing. | `get_result --match_id 7` before the oracle has reported anything for match 7 → `#3`. |
| 4 | `AlreadyInitialized` | v0.1.0 | [`initialize`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | `initialize` was called a second time. | No action needed — the contract is already configured. | Re-running a deploy script unconditionally → `#4` on the second run. |
| 5 | `ContractPaused` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_batch_results`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`delete_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | Admin called `pause`. | Wait for `unpause`; poll a paused-status check before retrying. | Result submission attempted during an incident-response pause → `#5`. |
| 6 | `InvalidGameId` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_batch_results`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | `game_id` is empty in the submission (or in any batch entry). | Resubmit with the real platform game ID populated. | A batch entry built from a malformed scrape with `game_id = ""` → `#6`. |
| 7 | `BatchTooLarge` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_batch_results`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | `entries.len() > 100` (`MAX_BATCH_SIZE`). | Split the batch into chunks of ≤100 entries. | Submitting 250 tournament results in one call → `#7`. |
| 8 | `BatchDuplicateEntry` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_batch_results`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | Two entries in the same batch share a `match_id`. | De-duplicate entries client-side — each `match_id` may appear once per batch. | A batch builder accidentally includes the same `match_id` twice after a join bug → `#8`. |
| 9 | `RateLimitExceeded` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_batch_results`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) (via `check_oracle_rate_limit`) | The submission(s) would exceed the oracle's configured hourly or daily sliding-window limit (see `set_oracle_rate_limits`). | Check `get_oracle_rate_limit_status` for remaining quota and window reset timing; wait for the window to roll over, or have the admin raise the limit. | An oracle service burst-submits 150 results in one hour against the default 100/hour limit → `#9` once the limit is hit, with an `oracle / alert` event already emitted at 80% usage. |
| 10 | `InvalidRateLimit` | v0.1.0 | [`set_oracle_rate_limits`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | `hourly_limit > daily_limit` when both are non-zero. | Pass consistent limits (`hourly_limit <= daily_limit`), or pass `0` for either to fall back to the contract default. | `set_oracle_rate_limits(oracle, 500, 100)` → `#10`. |
| 11 | `InsufficientStake` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_batch_results`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) (for consensus-based submission) | The oracle has registered stake but it has been slashed to zero or is below the minimum required for participation. | Re-register with `register_oracle_with_stake` and deposit sufficient collateral. | An oracle's stake was slashed due to equivocation or SLA violations, and they attempt to submit without re-staking → `#11`. |
| 12 | `NotRegisteredOracle` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) (consensus submission path) | `submit_oracle_result` was called by an address that has never registered via `register_oracle_with_stake`. | Call `register_oracle_with_stake` first with the required collateral amount. | A new oracle service instance attempts consensus voting without first registering → `#12`. |
| 13 | `InvalidPauseState` | v0.2.0 | [`pause`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`unpause`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | `pause` was called on an already-paused contract, or `unpause` was called on a contract that is not currently paused. Prevents redundant state transitions and duplicate events. | Check the current pause state before calling `pause`/`unpause`. If unsure, use a monitoring tool or event log to determine whether the contract is currently paused. | Admin calls `pause` twice in a row → `#13` on the second call. Calling `unpause` on a freshly deployed (unpaused) contract → `#13`. |
| 14 | `MatchDisputed` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | The match's consensus has deadlocked (no remaining oracle vote can push any candidate result over the threshold) and is awaiting admin resolution via `resolve_disputed_match`. | Do not submit further votes; await admin resolution. Once resolved, the final result will be recorded. | During a close vote, no oracle can push any candidate over the threshold, so the match enters disputed state and `submit_oracle_result` returns `#14`. |
| 15 | `InvalidThreshold` | v0.1.0 | [`set_consensus_threshold`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | `set_consensus_threshold` was called with a threshold of 0 (invalid for consensus). | Pass a threshold ≥ 1 (e.g., 2 for 2-of-N voting). | `set_consensus_threshold(oracle, 0)` → `#15`. |
| 16 | `MatchNotDisputed` | v0.1.0 | [`resolve_disputed_match`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | `resolve_disputed_match` was called for a match that is not in a disputed (deadlocked) consensus state. | Confirm the match is actually disputed by checking its consensus state. Do not call resolve on a non-disputed match. | Admin tries to resolve a match that finished normally (not disputed) → `#16`. |
| 17 | `OracleDeactivated` | v0.1.0 | [`submit_oracle_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`submit_result`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) (SLA enforcement) | The oracle has been deactivated due to repeated SLA violations (slow response time, low accuracy, or other metrics). | Not immediately recoverable — oracle must contact admin or re-register after a cooldown to restore status. | An oracle's average response time drifted above 5s SLA threshold, triggering automatic deactivation → `#17`. |
| 18 | `OracleNotSlow` | v0.1.0 | [`deactivate_slow_oracle`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | Attempted to deactivate an oracle that has a good SLA (average response time ≤ 5s). | Do not call deactivation on a well-performing oracle. | Admin tries to deactivate an oracle with 2s average response time → `#18`. |
| 19 | `InvalidAmount` | v0.1.0 | Rate/stake functions | A stake or fee amount is invalid (typically zero or negative). | Supply a positive amount. | Calling `register_oracle_with_stake` with `stake_amount = 0` → `#19`. |
| 20 | `Overflow` | v0.1.0 | Arithmetic operations (stake accumulation, voting tallies) | An arithmetic guard tripped: a counter or accumulated amount exceeded numeric bounds. | Not typically recoverable client-side. Indicates a contract state issue; contact admin for investigation. | After thousands of slash+re-stake cycles, the oracle's tally counters overflow → `#20` (rare, fatal). |
| 21 | `SlippageExceeded` | v0.1.0 | Rate/swap validation | The price changed beyond acceptable slippage bounds between submission and execution. | Resubmit with a wider slippage tolerance or wait for prices to stabilize. | Submitting a swap with 0.5% max slippage when market moved 1% → `#21`. |
| 22 | `StakeTokenMismatch` | v0.1.0 | [`register_oracle_with_stake`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | The oracle already has a registration, and this call's `token` differs from the token backing the existing registration — stake in two different tokens cannot be summed. | Re-register (top up) using the same token as the original registration, or coordinate with the admin to migrate the stake before switching tokens. | An oracle registered with USDC, then attempts to top up its stake with EURC → `#22`; the existing USDC-denominated stake is left untouched. |
| 23 | `SlashNotFound` | v0.1.0 | [`finalize_slash`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`admin_cancel_slash`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | No pending slash exists for the given (oracle, match_id) pair — it was never staged, already finalized, or already cancelled. | Check `get_pending_slash` before calling `finalize_slash` or `admin_cancel_slash`. | Calling `finalize_slash` after the slash was already finalized → `#23`. |
| 24 | `SlashGracePeriodNotElapsed` | v0.1.0 | [`finalize_slash`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | `finalize_slash` was called before `slashing_grace_period_ledgers` ledgers have elapsed since the slash was staged. | Wait until `eligible_ledger` (from `get_pending_slash`) has been reached, then retry. | Calling `finalize_slash` 100 ledgers after staging when the grace period is 200 ledgers → `#24`. |
| 25 | `RateNotFound` | v0.2.0 | [`get_rate`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`get_rate_with_age`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs), [`swap`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | No rate has been set for the requested `(token_a, token_b)` pair via `set_rate`, or the stored rate is older than `MAX_RATE_AGE_LEDGERS` (~1 day) and has been rejected as stale by `swap`. Previously (before v0.2.0) `get_rate` returned `ResultNotFound` (#3) and `swap` also used that code — the new code gives callers a distinct, unambiguous signal. | For a missing rate: have the admin call `set_rate` for the pair. For a stale rate: the admin must call `set_rate` again to refresh it. Use `get_rate_with_age` to inspect the current age before swapping. | `get_rate(token_a, token_b)` before any rate has been set → `#25`. `swap` called with a rate last set 18,000 ledgers ago (> 17,280 ledger limit) → `#25`. |
| 26 | `InvalidRate` | v0.2.0 | [`set_rate`](../contracts/oracle/src/lib.rs) | The `rate` supplied to `set_rate` is zero or negative — rates must be positive to be economically meaningful. Previously (before v0.2.0) `set_rate` returned `InvalidRateLimit` (#10), which is the code for mismatched rate-limit config, not an invalid exchange rate. The new code is precise and distinct. | Supply a positive rate value (> 0). The rate is scaled by 1e7: use `10_000_000` for a 1:1 exchange rate. | `set_rate(token_a, token_b, 0)` → `#26`. `set_rate(token_a, token_b, -1)` → `#26`. |

## Troubleshooting quick-lookup table

Use this when you only know the *symptom*, not the code.

| Symptom | Likely error(s) | First thing to check |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| "Transaction failed, can't tell why" | Any | Decode the numeric code from the tx result (`Error(Contract, #N)`), then look it up above. |
| Deposit/submit/cancel rejected right after deploy | `Unauthorized` (Escrow #4 / Oracle #1) | Did you call `initialize` on this contract yet? `is_initialized`. |
| `submit_result` rejected — oracle key mismatch | `NotOracle` / `Unauthorized` (Escrow #4) | Confirm the oracle service key matches `get_oracle`; if rotated, admin must call `update_oracle`. |
| Admin call rejected — admin key mismatch | `NotAdmin` / `Unauthorized` (Escrow #4 / Oracle #1) | Confirm you're signing with the key returned by `get_admin`. Use `is_initialized` to rule out uninitialized contract. |
| Player can't deposit | `MatchNotFound` (#1), `InvalidState` (#5), `AlreadyFunded` (#2), `Unauthorized` (#4), `ContractPaused` (#9) | `get_match` — confirm the ID exists, state is `Pending`, and you haven't already deposited. If `#9`, distinguish a contract-wide pause (`is_paused`) from a per-player freeze (`is_player_frozen`). |
| Oracle can't submit a result | `ContractPaused` (#9 / #5), `MatchNotFound` (#1), `NotFunded` (#3), `Unauthorized` (#4 / #1), `RateLimitExceeded` (#9 oracle) | `is_paused`, `is_funded`, `get_oracle_rate_limit_status`. |
| Oracle can't submit a result | `ContractPaused` (#9 / #5), `MatchNotFound` (#1), `NotFunded` (#3), `Unauthorized` (#4 / #1), `RateLimitExceeded` (#9 oracle) | `is_paused`, `is_funded`, `get_oracle_rate_limit_status`. |
| `create_match` rejected | `InvalidAmount` (#10), `InvalidGameId` (#15), `DuplicateGameId` (#13), `InvalidPlayers` (#16), `TokenNotAllowed` (#17), `ContractPaused` (#9) | Validate `stake_amount > 0`, `game_id` format/uniqueness, distinct players, `get_allowed_tokens` if allowlisting is on, and `is_token_blacklisted` to verify the token is not banned. If `#9`, check `is_paused` (contract-wide) and `is_player_frozen` for either named player (per-player freeze via `admin_freeze_player`). `TokenNotAllowed` (#17) covers both an allowlist miss and an admin-managed blacklist hit (`add_token_to_blacklist`) — the `Error` enum is at its 50-variant XDR cap (see `contracts/escrow/src/errors.rs`), so blacklist and freeze rejection reuse existing codes rather than adding new ones. |
| Can't cancel a match | `MatchAlreadyActive` (#19), `InvalidState` (#5), `Unauthorized` (#4) | `get_match` — cancellation only works on `Pending` matches you're a player in. |
| `expire_match` rejected | `MatchNotExpired` (#14), `InvalidState` (#5), `MatchNotFound` (#1) | Compare `get_match_timeout` against the match's `created_ledger`. |
| Oracle batch submission rejected | `BatchTooLarge` (#7), `BatchDuplicateEntry` (#8), `InvalidGameId` (#6), `AlreadySubmitted` (#2) | Validate the batch client-side before sending: size ≤100, unique `match_id`s, non-empty `game_id`s. |
| Admin config call rejected | `Unauthorized` (#4 / #1), `InvalidTimeout` (Escrow #20), `InvalidRateLimit` (Oracle #10), `InvalidAddress` (Escrow #18) | Confirm you're signing with the current admin key and that the new value is within the documented bounds. |
| A match seems permanently stuck on `submit_result` | `Overflow` (Escrow #8, fatal) | Check `stake_amount` isn't absurdly large; recover funds via `cancel_match`/`expire_match` instead of retrying `submit_result`. |

## Coverage

This document covers all variants present in source as of 2026-08-29:

- Escrow (`contracts/escrow/src/errors.rs`): 50/50 active variant slots documented. Variants at discriminants **11**, **12**, **38**, **44**, and **53** are **reserved gaps** (see the Reserved Codes section below and the individual table entries above). The active variants are 1–10, 13–37, 39–43, 45–52, 54–55.
- Oracle (`contracts/oracle/src/errors.rs`): 27 variants documented (discriminants 1–15, 17–27). Discriminant 16 is unassigned; 13 (`InvalidPauseState`), 25 (`RateNotFound`), and 26 (`InvalidRate`) were added in v0.2.0.

If `cargo build` or a code review surfaces a new variant in either
`errors.rs`, add a row here in the same PR — this file is expected to stay in
lockstep with the source enums.

---

## Reserved Error Codes

The following discriminants in the **Escrow contract** error enum are currently unassigned (gaps). They were previously occupied by variants that have since been removed. If your client SDK surfaces one of these codes, treat it as `UnknownContractError` — it will not appear from any currently deployed contract function.

| Code | Previously named | Removed because |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 11 | `RollbackWindowExpired` | Variant removed when `dispute_and_rollback_match` was refactored |
| 12 | `ReasonTooLong` | Variant removed in the same refactor as `#11` |
| 38 | `InvalidConversionRate` | Superseded by `#39 ConversionRateOutOfBounds`; removed to consolidate conversion-rate validation |
| 44 | `OracleSlashFailed` | Variant removed when oracle slashing logic was redesigned |
| 53 | *(never assigned)* | Gap between `ConflictingResult` (#52) and `NotAnOracle` (#54); slot never had a variant |

**50-variant XDR ceiling:** The escrow enum is at the Soroban-enforced cap of 50 variants. A reserved slot must be reclaimed before any new variant can be added. Current available slots: 11, 12, 38, 44, 53.

## Error Code Changelog

This section tracks when error codes were introduced or changed. Use it to handle unknown codes gracefully — if your SDK predates a `Since` version, treat unrecognized numeric codes as generic `UnknownContractError` rather than a hard failure.

### v0.1.0 (initial release)

All error codes documented in this file were introduced in v0.1.0. The `Since` column in each table above records `v0.1.0` for all existing variants.

**Escrow contract** — codes 1–21 (core lifecycle errors) and codes 22–50 (dispute resolution, vesting, tiers, and upgrade errors) introduced.

**Oracle contract** — codes 1–12 and 14–22 introduced (code 13 is not assigned).

### v0.2.0 (unreleased)

**Oracle contract**

- Added `#13 InvalidPauseState` (since v0.2.0) — returned by `pause` when the contract is already paused, or by `unpause` when the contract is not currently paused. Fills the previously unassigned gap at discriminant 13. Prevents duplicate state transitions and spurious events, bringing the oracle in line with the escrow contract's `InvalidPauseState` behaviour.
- Added `#25 RateNotFound` (since v0.2.0) — returned by `get_rate`, `get_rate_with_age`, and `swap` when no rate has been set for the requested `(token_a, token_b)` pair, or when `swap` finds the rate is older than `MAX_RATE_AGE_LEDGERS` (~1 day). Replaces the misleading `ResultNotFound` (#3) previously returned by `get_rate` and `swap`.
- Added `#26 InvalidRate` (since v0.2.0) — returned by `set_rate` when the `rate` argument is zero or negative. Replaces the misleading `InvalidRateLimit` (#10) previously returned by `set_rate`.

### Adding new error codes

When a new error variant is added to `contracts/escrow/src/errors.rs` or `contracts/oracle/src/errors.rs`:

1. Add a new row to the relevant table in this document in the same PR.
2. Set the `Since` column to the next unreleased version (e.g. `v0.2.0`).
3. Add an entry to this changelog section under a new `### vX.Y.Z (unreleased)` heading.

Example changelog entry format:

```
### v0.2.0 (unreleased)

**Escrow contract**
- Added `#51 TokenBlacklisted` (since v0.2.0) — returned by `create_match` when the
  token is on the admin blacklist. Previously reused `#17 TokenNotAllowed`; the new
  code gives callers a distinct signal to surface a clearer error message.
```
