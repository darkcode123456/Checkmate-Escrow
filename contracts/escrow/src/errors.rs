use soroban_sdk::contracterror;

/// Escrow contract error codes and variants.
///
/// Every error is represented as a small integer (`u32`) discriminant. When a contract call fails,
/// the CLI/SDK returns something like `Error(Contract, #4)`.
///
/// **For the complete error reference with causes, recovery actions, and examples,**
/// **see [`docs/error-codes.md`](../../../docs/error-codes.md).**
///
/// This document is kept in lockstep with this enum — if you add or remove a variant,
/// update `docs/error-codes.md` in the same PR.
///
/// This enum is at the XDR-enforced cap of 50 variants
/// (`ScSpecUdtErrorEnumV0::cases` is a `VecM<_, 50>`), so no further variants can be
/// added. Adding a new error requires either freeing a slot by repurposing an existing,
/// semantically-close variant, or removing one that's been superseded — which is why
/// the player-freeze feature reuses `ContractPaused` (see `admin_freeze_player`).
